We aim to be a good corporate citizen  and an employer of choice.  Our areas of focus for growth are Energy  Supply, Services, Connected Home,  Distributed Energy & Power, Energy  Marketing & Trading. We also have a  material Exploration & Production division. We supply energy and services to over 25  million customer accounts mainly in the UK,  Ireland and North America through strong  brands such as British Gas, Direct Energy  and Bord Gáis Energy, all supported by  around 15,000 engineers and technicians.  We are focused on delivering high levels of  customer service, engagement and loyalty. Technology is increasingly important in  the delivery of energy and services to our  customers. We are developing innovative  products, offers and solutions, underpinned  by investment in technology. In 2017 we  announced the creation of a new venture  ‘Centrica Innovations’ to identify, incubate  and accelerate new technologies and  innovations. At the end of 2017 , phase one of Centrica’s  repositioning was complete. We have  simplified our business and portfolio.  We now have just three divisions –  Centrica Consumer, Centrica Business  and Exploration & Production. Our asset  portfolio has been materially repositioned. We delivered our £750 million per annum  cost efficiency programme three years early  and met our net debt targets. We are seeing  encouraging signs of progress in our  customer-facing businesses. In our next  phase to 2020, we will further shift  investment towards those businesses and  focus on performance delivery, specifically  growing gross margin and driving a further  £500 million per annum of cost efficiencies,  while maintaining financial discipline.

This would be a tough undertaking even in a  benign and supportive political environment.  As it is, the pressures we have faced from  this quarter in our important home market  have raised the degree of competitive  difficulty and created an air of uncertainty  that weighed heavily on our share price  in 2017 . I am disappointed that the many  actions we have taken to help vulnerable  customers, bring old tariff models to an  end and reward loyalty have received little  recognition from politicians.  Our response has been to strive to make  Centrica more resilient to our external  environment. This requires a fundamental  repositioning of our organisation, processes  and systems, integrating a hitherto  fragmented structure, always in the service  of our customers. This must all necessarily  be executed at pace, because to stand  still in our fast-moving sector is to invite  obsolescence, and because our employees  understandably want to get to the other side  as quickly as possible. There is a palpable  desire within Centrica to find new ways of  accelerating cultural change, building  innovative capabilities and better meeting  our customers’ expectations at a lower cost. Accordingly, the business is being rebuilt  on a firm foundation. Underlying everything,  and essential to long-term value creation,  has been the considerable work done by  Iain Conn and his senior leadership team in  focusing on our core businesses of energy  supply and services, and the propositions  which our customers expect today and  desire tomorrow.  All the while ensuring that the fundamentals  of change – our purpose, our new values and  new ethical standards – are fresh, relevant  and deep rooted, with safety, compliance  and conduct at the top of our agenda. The strategic transition is being delivered well  and all of our declared financial targets have  been met. But there have also been areas of  weakness, particularly in our North American  power book during the second half of the  year. The impact of competitive and pricing  pressures here was exacerbated by a  seasonally weak performance from our  North American gas business and the  discovery of an historical accounting issue.  Our control systems are being enhanced  and improved and the accounting issue  was verified as having been a one-off.  But not before deep damage had been
