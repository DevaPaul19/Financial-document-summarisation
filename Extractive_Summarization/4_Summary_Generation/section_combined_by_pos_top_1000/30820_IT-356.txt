It is here that I would like to take the opportunity to thank each and  every employee on behalf of our shareholders and the Board for all their efforts  in this area. I have been impressed by the hard work and commitment shown  by all of our teams. While we recognise that we don’t get everything right and  there is still, of course, more work to do, it has been very pleasing to see a  significant improvement in our customer satisfaction scores in recent months,  which validates the investments and efforts we have made into enhancements  in this area. We will be prioritising further improvements in customer service  in 2018.  It is, however, equally, if not more important, to acknowledge, reflect on and  address situations where we have not always got it right. Following concern  expressed by some customers, during 2017 we carried out a review of  historic lease structures and, in particular, ten-year doubling ground rent  clauses, which we had stopped using on new developments from late 2011.  Whilst Taylor Wimpey implemented these leases in good faith and the terms  were clearly set out in the relevant leases, it was clear from our review that   the impact of these doubling rent review clauses was causing some of   our customers understandable concern, particularly from a mortgageability  and saleability perspective. We acknowledge that the introduction of these  doubling clauses in 2007 was not consistent with our high standards of  customer service and we have quite rightly apologised to customers for   the unintended consequences and concern that we caused. In our Annual  General Meeting trading update of April 2017, we announced that we   would make a provision, before tax, of £130 million in the first half accounts   to allow us to put things right for our affected customers. At the same time,  we implemented, on a voluntary basis, the Taylor Wimpey Ground Rent  Review Assistance Scheme, to enable us to work with the relevant freeholders  who own the leases, in order to convert our customers’ ten-year doubling  ground rent clauses to leases based on RPI, should they elect to participate  in the Scheme.  As part of our review, we also stopped selling houses on a leasehold basis   on our new developments with effect from the start of 2017, other than in  exceptional circumstances such as where Taylor Wimpey does not own   the site on a freehold basis. Charities and local community groups We believe that as a responsible business, we must actively contribute to  helping others whether financially, with our time, energy or expertise. We  remain highly committed to supporting charities and local community groups  in the areas in which we operate, and I am extremely proud to see the  personal commitments our employees continue to make to our charitable  partners. We aim to be an aspirational housebuilding brand that is recognised  for the good that is given back to our local communities by both our  employees and our business as a whole. Our primary goal is to genuinely  improve the position of the causes that we support. The other goal is to  engage our employees in these activities as we recognise it is good for their  personal development and self-awareness. During 2017, it was pleasing to  see many of our employees participate
