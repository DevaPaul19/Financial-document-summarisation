Our purpose Finding better waysTM to provide the materials the world needs For 150 years, we have been looking for new and better ways of doing things. Our drive for innovation and continuous improvement is at the core of our purpose. Today, you will find our teams around the world seeking opportunities to reduce our carbon footprint, partnering to develop new technologies to decarbonise steel and aluminium production, and creating new products from waste. Our ambition is to be a business with a commodity mix that is aligned with evolving customer demand in a decarbonising world. But we cannot do it on our own. So we strive to create partnerships that solve problems and create win-win solutions with lower societal and environmental impact. The approach applies as much to large-scale, transformational innovation as to incremental everyday progress, such as our safety and operational performance. And we are finding better ways to partner with Indigenous peoples and host communities. From continuing to rebuild our relationships to putting in place our new co-management agreements and improved ways of working, we are focusing on open and transparent engagement. Our aspiration is to be the partner of choice for communities, governments, customers, suppliers and joint venture partners. We want to be a home to curious people who care about their work and colleagues, are courageous about the challenges they face and find better ways to do things.  At a glance Our business 1 We operate in 35 countries where our 54,000 employees are working to find better ways to  provide the materials the world needs.
