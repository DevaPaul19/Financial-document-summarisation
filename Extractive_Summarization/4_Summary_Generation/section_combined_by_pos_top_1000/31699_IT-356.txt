We have continued to deliver good like-for -like sales growth in our existing business, as  well as a significant increase in net contract gains, which are strengthening our presence  across the world. Allied to this, our strategic initiatives have delivered further operational  improvements and margin growth. We announced a number of important contract wins in the year, further extending our  presence in North America and in the Rest of the World, where there are significant  structural growth opportunities. Additionally, this year we have entered the Indian market  through a joint venture, and the initial performance of this business has been encouraging.  In 2017 we increased our capital expenditure to a record ¬£115m , reflecting the strong  increase in net contract gains. Our approach to new business is disciplined and focuses on  ensuring that we generate good returns on investment. Our success is underpinned by our  ability to deliver an attractive brand line-up and innovative bespoke concepts for our clients  and customers. We continue to invest in our people, strengthening central, regional and local  teams around the world. Dividend As a result of the Group‚Äôs strong performance, I am pleased to announce that the Board has  recommended a final dividend of 4.9 pence per share (subject to shareholder approval at the  Annual General Meeting in February 2018), making a total dividend for the year of 8.1 pence  per share, which is at the top end of the dividend payout ratio range we announced at the  time of IPO. The Board also proposes a special dividend of approximately ¬£100m which will  be in addition to the final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2017 . This reflects our  confidence in the future of the business and our desire to maintain an efficient balance sheet. Sustainability SSP continues to be committed to operating sustainably in its markets and to responsibly  manage those environmental and social issues which have been identified as material to our  business. We have made further good progress in the year in the priority areas as set out on  pages 23 to 25.  Our employees and stakeholders The strength of the Group is principally due to our employees‚Äô skills, experience and  dedication. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of our employees for their  contribution during the year . Outlook Looking forward, we have secured some important new business wins, which means our  pipeline is encouraging. Increasing passenger numbers around the world, both in the airport  and rail sectors, provide significant structural growth opportunities. I am confident that  SSP can continue to benefit from these trends and deliver sustainable value creation  for shareholders. With this in mind, the Board looks forward to delivering another good  performance in the year ahead.
