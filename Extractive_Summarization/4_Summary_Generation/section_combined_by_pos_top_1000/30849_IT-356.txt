Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction 03 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017 04 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Chairman’s statement In 2018 we celebrate 25 years since the  launch of the company in January 1993. The  core of the company’s success remains the  distinctive Admiral culture which drives  the way that our people work and serve our  customers in the UK, Italy, Spain, France and  the US. 2006 “ On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all the 9,600 people at Admiral for   their continued hard work and contribution to a record-breaking set of results   for the Group in 2017.” I am delighted and honoured to have taken  over the helm as the Chairman of Admiral  at the AGM in April 2017. My predecessor,  Alastair Lyons, who ably steered the ship for  over 16 years, has left some large shoes to  fill. I would like to thank him for his service  and enabling a smooth transition. As Chairman of the Group I will focus my  efforts on:  • Continuing to build on the remarkably  special Admiral culture and in so doing  putting our people and customers at   the heart of what we do • Continuing the history of growth,  profitability and innovation • Investing in the development and   growth of our people • Ensuring excellent governance  and the highest standards. 2017 Overview Admiral Group has delivered another record  set of results in 2017: record turnover and  profit, strong return on capital, strong  solvency ratio and record customer numbers. The Group has continued to grow strongly  with turnover increasing by 15% to £2.96  billion. Customer numbers increased 11% to  over 5.7 million. The Group’s share of pre-tax profit increased  by 43% to £405.4 million. Earnings per share  and return on equity both increased by 49%  to 117.2 pence and 55% respectively. The  Group’s solvency ratio remains very strong  at 205%. In UK Insurance, there was another strong  performance from the Group’s core UK  Motor business where the number of insured  vehicles grew by 8% to 3.96 million. In line  with usual trends, profitability benefited  from significant prior year reserve releases.  2007 Balumba.es  launched Admiral’s first non-UK  insurance brand, based  in Seville, Spain.
