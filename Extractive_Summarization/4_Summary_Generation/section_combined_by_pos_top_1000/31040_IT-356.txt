Polypipe supplied a complete  prefabricated solution using Polystorm  geocellular tanks, together with pipework,  manholes and catchpits all manufactured  off-site. The final design saw the installation  of two Polystorm geocellular tanks at a depth  of 3.2 metres, under two resident owned car  parks on the Linnet Rise site, providing 366m 3   and 479m 3  of storage respectively. The solution  was retrofitted to the existing area with  minimal disruption to local residents to provide  long-lasting flood protection. This retrofitted   flood alleviation   scheme was designed  and prepared off-site   to minimise disruption  for this busy   residential area MARKET LEADERSHIP BESPOKE PRODUCT SOLUTIONS 02 STRATEGIC REPORT POLYPIPE AT A GLANCE 04 CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION 06 POLYPIPE’S VALUE-CREATION MODEL 07 POLYPIPE’S MARKETPLACE 08 POLYPIPE’S BUSINESS MODEL 10 STRATEGY 12 KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 14 OUR SUSTAINABLE JOURNEY 15 OUR SUSTAINABLE JOURNEY IN ACTION 18 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW 22 CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REPORT 26 PRINCIPAL RISKS & UNCERTAINTIES 30 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT 35 CASE STUDY Project Linnet Rise Flood Alleviation Scheme,  Kidderminster Client NMCNomenca; Severn Trent Water Application Sustainable Drainage System (SuDS) Car park in use after project completion 03 RESIDENTIAL SYSTEMS Areas of application  { Above-ground drainage  { Storm water drainage  { Below-ground drainage systems  { Sewer drain  { Water supply  { Plumbing and heating supply  { Underfloor heating systems  { Mechanical Ventilation with   Heat Recovery  { Positive Input Ventilation  { Indoor air quality solutions  { Smart controls  { Merchandised, pre-packaged components Areas of application  { Above-ground drainage  { Surface water drainage  { Storm water drainage  { Land drainage and irrigation  { Sewer drain  { Ducting and conduit  { Pressure systems  { Air Handling Units  { Ventilation solutions with heat recovery  { Indoor air quality solutions  { Smart controls integrated with Building  Management Systems  { Green infrastructure REVENUE £223.5m UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT £44.3m REVENUE £188.2m UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT £28.3m COMMERCIAL AND  INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS  Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 Polypipe Group plc 04 POLYPIPE AT A GLANCE Polypipe is firmly established as one of  Europe’s largest and most innovative  manufacturers of plastic piping systems,  with over 20,000 product lines and 195  UK and European product approvals.

Despite the continued economic  and political uncertainty that has prevailed  since the EU Referendum and a mixed UK  construction market performance, our end  markets continue to perform well, with the  Group growing UK revenue significantly  ahead of the UK construction market. As  well as managing this growth, the Group  has also seen a number of key leadership  changes during the year, including the  retirement of David Hall in October 2017  following 12 years as CEO, and the  promotion of Martin Payne from CFO to  CEO following David’s retirement. Glen  Sabin was promoted to the role of Chief  Operating Officer and appointed to the  Board in October 2017, and the Company  Secretarial function was also brought in- house following the appointment of Emma  Versluys as Company Secretary. Paul James  joined the Company and Board as Chief  06 Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 Polypipe Group plc 06 CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION In the 1980s Polypipe’s offer was  largely a basic product offer of discrete  lengths of pipe and fittings sold through  distribution, which over the years  has
