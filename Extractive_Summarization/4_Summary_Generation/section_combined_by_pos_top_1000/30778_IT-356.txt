Our  PeoplePlus division has met the challenge of  delivering the final years of the existing Work  Programme, continuing to be the best  performing supplier to the DWP and  positioning itself to become a leading  supplier of Apprenticeship Levy training.  Other opportunities during 2017 included  winning the Fair Start programme in  Scotland.  Performance 2017 was the final year of our five-year  plan to “Burst the Billion”, aiming to  grow Group revenues to over £1bn by  2017. Group revenues of £957.8m (2016:  £882.4m), up 9%, leaves us just short  of this target. However, the exiting run  rate of 2017 exceeds this target and  remains a significant achievement  compared to the starting point of  revenues of £367m in 2012, when the  five-year plan began. The five-year  underlying operating profit target of  £30m was comfortably exceeded, being  achieved two years early, in 2015. Underlying profit before tax* reduced  by 1% to £36.3m (2016: £36.7m). Whilst  a reduction, this is a good achievement  given the Work Programme run-off  in PeoplePlus that began in March  2017. Reported profit before tax  increased by 28% to £24.1m (2016:  £18.9m), primarily due to exceptional  reorganisation costs incurred in  2016 not being repeated in 2017. Cash generation was again strong,  with free cash flows (being EBITDA plus  working capital movement, less tax paid  and capex) amounting to £37.9m. Net  debt** fell by £20.2m, from £36.7m at  the end of December 2016 to £16.5m  at the end of December 2017. This  provides the Group with a solid base  from which to continue to generate  shareholder value into the future.
