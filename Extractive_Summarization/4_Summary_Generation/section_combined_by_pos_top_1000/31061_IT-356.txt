Thisseemstoflyinthefaceoftheall toocommontime-wastingfrustrations associatedwithdial-inconferencing: “Thataccesscodeisn’trecognised.” “Whojustjoined?”“Whoisitwith allthebackgroundnoise?” Respondentsthoughtthat15 minutes werewastedonatypicalcallgetting themeetingstartedanddealing withdistractions.That’smore thanathirdofthetimetheworld spendsonconferencecalls. Thesecurityconnotationsarearguably moreconcerningstill.Overhalfofthe respondentsconsidereditquitenormal nottoknowexactlywho’sontheir conferencecalls.Withtheexperience clearlysofarfromperfect,whydo themajoritypersistwithdial-inrather thanembracingsoftwarealternatives thatmightofferabetterexperience? Theanswer,LoopUpbelieves,lies inthewaypeopletendtoadopt software.Formost,thisisaprocessof trialanderrorovertime.Ashostofa remotemeeting,however,you’relive inthe’hotseat’withmultipleguests. Itsimplyisn’tconducivetotrial-and- error-basedlearning.Thelastthing youwantisforanythingtogowrong, andwhiledial-inmaywellbeapoor experience,atleastpeopleareusedto it.Everyonecandialaphonenumber andpunchinanaccesscode.

LoopUp offers a superior service to clients  and customers.  Lady Barbara Judge CBE  Since joining the board at IPO in 2016,  I have been pleased to be a part of  LoopUp’s excellent momentum in the  market and look forward to the  Company maintaining this trend during  2018 and beyond.  LoopUp addresses a significant problem  that businesses face – the proliferation  of painful, time-wasting conference calls  that frustrate busy professionals and  diminish their productivity every day.  Having experienced these very issues  myself, I have found LoopUp’s approach  an innovative alternative. Its business  model and growing adoption among  demanding enterprises is further proof  of the value LoopUp delivers to its  customers and shareholders. The Company continues to experience  strong demand for its differentiated  product, which combined with its  innovative and efficient Pods  organisational strategy, makes for  an exciting outlook, and we remain  confident in our ability to deliver  further growth. The Directors and executive team have  demonstrated their continued ability to  take the business forward as a public  company and maintain its upward  momentum. I remain confident that the  Company is well positioned to grow in  line with market expectations and  deliver against our strategic priorities in  the year to come.  I look forward to seeing you, our  shareholders, at our AGM on  15 June 2018. A note on corporate governance  LoopUp Group plc, as an AIM company,  is not required to comply (and does not  claim to comply) with the UK Corporate  Governance Code (‘the Code’). The  Board, however, recognizes the  importance of the principles set out in  the Code and remains committed to the  maintenance of high standards of  corporate governance.  After due consideration, the Board  seeks to apply those aspects of the  Code as far as it considers appropriate  for a business of this size and nature.
