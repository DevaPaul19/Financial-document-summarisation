Ross Graham Chairman 07 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 I am delighted to report another excellent  performance, with the Group having  delivered significant revenue growth,   whilst maintaining margins, to achieve   a 55% increase in adjusted profit before   tax to €23.0m in the year (2016: €14.9m).  The Group’s strong performance reflects   the continuation of our proven strategy   to supplement strong organic growth with  acquisitions that further extend the Group’s  services and geographical reach to position  us as the leading creative and technical  services provider to the global video games  industry.

In addition, we have invested in expanding  capacity at many of our studios including  Montreal, Zhengzhou, Manila, Dublin, Madrid  and Tokyo during the year with further  investments in expansion planned for 2018.  Managing and funding growth Part of the success of the Group can be  attributed to the ability of the management  team to source, execute and integrate  acquisitions effectively across the globe   and across our service lines whilst retaining  the Keywords culture, which is a particular  competency the team has built since IPO.  That this has been accomplished across   all of our service lines, now embracing   over 40 studios in 20 countries, during   2017 is a notable achievement.  During the year, we raised £75m via a   placing (before expenses), which was very  well subscribed and we would like to thank  our shareholders for their continued support.  Since the year end, we have agreed terms   for a new bank facility, initially
