Financial results The Group’s trading results for the year  ended 30 September 2017 show revenue  of £21.56 million (2016: £21.32 million)  and operating profit of £3.90 million  (2016: £3.69 million) after adjusting for  the amortisation of acquisition-related  intangibles, ‘one-off’ non-recurring items and  share-based payment charges. The ‘one-off’  non-recurring items, totalling £0.49 million,  include costs relating to potential acquisitions  during the year, the consolidation of office  premises with internal reorganisation, as  well as the costs incurred in changing the  Group Finance Director. Mitigating and  offsetting these costs, was the receipt in full,  of a licence fee from a former customer who  had been disputing payment relating to their  access of the Group’s software. Overall, gross margin remains high at 82%  (2016: 84%) and though slightly lower than  the prior year, the continuing high gross  margin reflects the continued emphasis  and focus upon the supply of Sanderson  proprietary software and services. Recurring  revenue, which is revenue derived from pre- contracted software licence fees and ongoing  support services, increased to £11.18 million  (2016: £10.75 million) representing 52%  of total revenue in the period (2016:  50%). Sales order intake grew by 12% to  £13.69 million (2016: £12.26 million). The  Group order book at 30 September 2017  was £5.79 million (2016: £3.02 million)  and includes a significant new order from  an existing customer which is scheduled to  be delivered over the course of the next two  financial years. Sanderson has a strong, cash-generative  business model which has resulted in a  cash balance at 30 September 2017 of  £6.18 million (2016: £4.34 million), well  ahead of market expectations. This balance  is stated after the increased payment of  £1.38 million (2016: £1.21 million)
