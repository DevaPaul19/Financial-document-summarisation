In addition, we have launched two successful independent secondary funds, JLIF and JLEN, which are the purchasers of a number of our investments once the underlying projects reach the operational stage. As well as announcing our results, we are today launching a 1 for 3 rights issue to raise £210 million, net of costs. The rights issue will enable the Group to take advantage of a higher proportion of the attractive opportunities currently available to it and is consistent with the Board’s intention to increase the scale of the business over the medium term. We plan to use the proceeds to invest in public private partnership (PPP) projects, renewable energy assets, and in other appropriate greenfield infrastructure assets which fit our business model and meet our investment criteria. The Board considers the rights issue to be in the best interests of John Laing and its shareholders as a whole. During 2017, as in earlier years, we kept our strategy focused but also flexible. Our business model has stood the test of time and allows the management team to concentrate on the core tasks of origination of greenfield projects; active management of construction and operational risk; and timely realisations in order to monetise investments. We committed capital to each of our three core regions – Asia Pacific, Europe and North America – in the year. The US market in particular is now showing the potential we have been anticipating for some time. As well as two further renewable energy projects, we invested in the I-66 Managed Lanes project in Virginia. We continue to see strong demand for new greenfield infrastructure in each of our regions.
