 02 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements We will continue to build the  foundations for future dividend  progression. Chairman’s statement Whilst political and economic  uncertainty was a signiﬁcant distraction  for the markets in the year, the attraction  of secure income continued to grow.  Not only are we living in a low growth,  low interest rate environment but ageing  demographics are accentuating the  search for income and alternatives  to low yielding government bonds.  This need has already risen substantially  and will grow further in the years  to come. High quality companies  offering well-covered and growing  dividends ought to become ever  more highly prized. Our signiﬁcant and increasing  investment in distribution is delivering  excellent returns, sustainable income  growth and long term value for our  shareholders. The sector is beneﬁting  strongly from structural support as  UK consumers continue to migrate  to online. Conversely, physical retail  continues to face signiﬁcant challenges  from this online shift with the inevitable  space overcapacity this brings to the  retail market.  This ongoing structural demand for  distribution and lack of meaningful  supply has given us the conﬁdence  to increase our investment across  all distribution sub-sectors of mega  box, regional and urban logistics.  We continue to see good investment  and short cycle development  opportunities, particularly in urban  logistics, and we have now fully  committed the proceeds of our recent  equity placing into sensible, accretive  assets. Our distribution exposure is  expected to exceed 70% within the  current ﬁnancial year. Exposure to the best real estate sectors  is driving demand for our space  resulting in high occupancy, good like  for like income growth and strong ERV  uplifts. Our sector leading portfolio  metrics have been maintained thanks  to our strong occupier and property  relationships. Over the last four years,  through management activity, our  occupancy level has been above  99% and our unexpired lease term has  remained at 12.8 years with only 1% of  our leases due to expire within the next  three years.  Our predictable, repetitive and growing  income streams have allowed us to  progress the dividend again this year by  3.4%. An attractive dividend needs to  be adequately covered by operating  earnings and I’m pleased that we have  maintained the 1.1x dividend cover we  achieved last year.  We will continue to build the  foundations for future dividend  progression. Contractual rental uplifts  are embedded in over 50% of the  portfolio, we are achieving strong rent  review uplifts and are adding new  income from short cycle developments.  LondonMetric is well placed and I  am genuinely excited by its outlook  and look forward to the year  with conﬁdence. Patrick Vaughan Chairman 31 May 2017 Our objective is to own good assets with strong  real estate fundamentals. They must generate  income in excess of our dividend and have  a higher value in ﬁve years’ time.
