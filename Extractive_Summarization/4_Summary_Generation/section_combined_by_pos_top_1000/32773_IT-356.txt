Circle has successfully realised a year-on-year  growth of 19.9% in NAV, delivering a final NAV  of 183p per share, as well as a proposed final  dividend of 2.6p per share, an increase of 8.3%,  to bring the annual dividend to 5p. This growth  has come almost entirely through the team’s  strong asset management and stock picking  capabilities, with asset-transforming capex  programmes at key sites including K2, Kents  Hill Park in Milton Keynes and 36 Great Charles  Street in Birmingham, which reached completion  in the period, as well as solid progress being  made at Somerset House in Birmingham’s CBD.  Circle’s high level of tenant retention is largely  attributable to both the high standards of  management that we demand within our  multi-let properties and our flexible approach  to tenant renewal negotiations. Our vacancy  rate in the standing investment portfolio is less  than 1% as, where appropriate, we continue to  place a greater emphasis upon the certainty of  secure income and the creation of longer leases  in preference to the maximisation of rents. It is the strength of Circle’s asset management  that differentiates the Company from its  peers. In order to achieve lettings in a highly  competitive market, it is essential to respond  swiftly to tenants’ ever-changing occupational  demands. By listening to tenants and taking  advice from agents, the Company remains  totally aware of emerging occupier trends,  such as the increasing preference towards  characterful or individualistic offices, and is  able to increase value by providing supply for  this demand. This strategy to deliver best-in- class office properties in regional locations  was further supported by the successful  refinancing of Circle’s senior debt with RBS  following the agreement of a new £50m facility. Circle is well positioned in this uncertain  political and economic environment with a  closely managed business, a positive strategy  and an entrepreneurial management team  ready to exploit emerging opportunities.. Ian Henderson Chairman  3  Circle Property Plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financials Governance Strategic Report Strategic Report Throughout the year we have continued  with our asset management programme and  have now assembled a core portfolio of high  quality regional offices in prime locations  which are primarily well let to high quality  tenants on medium or long-term leases. As a  result, and because of the resilient demand  for the type of space we
