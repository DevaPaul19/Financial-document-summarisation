These results reflect our position  as a leading provider of engineering services to many of the  UK’s critical infrastructure assets and in particular our  strength in the nuclear, rail and water markets.  Group revenue, including £2.2m from a joint venture,  increased by 6.7% to £560.8m (2016: £525.7m) with operating  profit prior to impairment, amortisation and exceptional items,  increasing by 16.4% to £25.6m (2016: £22.0m), an operating  margin of 4.6% (2016: 4.2%). After accounting for impairment,  amortisation and exceptional items of £8.9m, operating profit  was £16.6m (2016: £19.0m). After finance costs and tax,  earnings per share prior to impairment, amortisation and  exceptional items increased by 21.6% to 33.36p (2016: 27.43p).  After accounting for impairment, amortisation and exceptional  items, basic earnings per share on continuing activities was  19.88p (2016: 23.53p).  Exceptional Items At the end of April 2017, the Group decided to withdraw from  its loss-making low pressure, small diameter gas pipe  replacement activities and as a result reviewed the carrying  value of its investment in that business. The Board  determined that a non-cash impairment charge of £5.8m  should be made which is included within exceptional items.  This was reported in the interim results. Our gas operations  are now completely focused on medium pressure activities.  This restructuring has resulted in £0.6m of exceptional  charges relating to redundancy and other costs.  Dividend The Board is proposing a final dividend of 6.0p per share,  increasing the full year dividend by 12.5% to 9.0p (2016: 8.0p).  The dividend will be paid on 13 March 2018 to shareholders  on the register as at 2 February 2018. Order Book The Group’s order book at 30 September 2017 was £511m  (2016: £516m), with the Engineering Services order book up  4% to £438m (2016: £421m).
