This level of commitment and passion  exists throughout Britvic and on behalf of the Board I would  like to thank all of them for their hard work. In October we  announced a proposal to close our Norwich site with the loss  of 242 roles. This was not an easy decision for the Board and  senior management team but one that we felt necessary to  protect the long-term prospects of the business. As a Board,  we are committed to treating those affected with respect and  dignity and the proposal in no way reflected their performance.  Every effort will be made to re-deploy those who wish to  transfer to other sites and we will provide every assistance  for those seeking to find new roles elsewhere. The Board Having succeeded Gerald as Chairman we have made  some further changes to the board. Sue Clark has been  appointed Chair of the Remuneration Committee and Ian  McHoul appointed Senior Independent Director whilst  remaining Chair of the Audit Committee. Both Sue and Ian  have extensive multinational experience that has benefited  the Board since they joined in recent years. In September,  Joanne Averiss stepped down from the board as the PepsiCo  nominated director. Ben Gordon will reach the end of his ninth  year of tenure in 2018 and it has been agreed that Ben will step  down in early 2018 and will not seek re-election at the AGM.  Both Joanne and Ben have made valuable contributions during  their tenure and I would like to thank them for their support  and wish them well for the future. In view of Joanne and  Ben’s retirement from the Board, I am delighted to announce  the appointment of Suniti Chauhan and William Eccleshare,  effective 29 November 2017. Suniti brings significant M&A,  corporate finance and development experience whilst William  has a strong background in marketing and innovation. They  are excellent additions to the the Board as we look to continue  to develop our business in the UK and internationally. Looking Ahead The long-term prospects for this business are good and on  behalf of the Board, we look forward to continuing to support  Simon, Mat and the wider management team as they continue  to deliver the strategy. Next year the business faces a unique  event with the introduction of the Soft Drinks Industry Levy  (SDIL) in both the UK and Ireland. Whilst this may well lead  to some short-term volatility in the industry, I am confident  we have the right portfolio to navigate through this challenge.  Britvic is in a strong position today and I am confident in its  ability to grow and capitalise on opportunities as they arise  in the future. The AGM will be held at 11am on 31 January 2018 at  the offices of Linklaters LLP and I look forward to seeing  you there.
