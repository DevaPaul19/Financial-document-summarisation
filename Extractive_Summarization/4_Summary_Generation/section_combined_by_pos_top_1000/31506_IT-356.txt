We are confident in our ability to continue to increase both our capabilities and shareholder value moving forward ” I am pleased to report to shareholders in respect of the year ended 31 December 2017. The year under review saw the Company make encouraging progress to its longer-term objective of being a leading international provider of regulatory compliance software and professional services. Our current focus is on the corporation tax software and services market in the UK and Ireland. In this business we met all internal and external targets including increasing our revenue, contracted annuity base and number of new customers. Of particular note has been the level of cash generated from the business, which has allowed us the reduce debt levels faster than initially planned. Further details of our progress in 2017 is set out in the following CEO and CFO reports. We made significant investments during 2017 to maintain, update and de-risk our solutions and services in light of the increasing regulatory landscape. Over time we expect more demand for automation and process control which is where we want to provide enhanced functionality and value. We look forward to extending our technology offering by way of continued product development and targeted acquisitions. In particular, in the shorter term, to broaden the range of taxes covered. The integration of OSMO, acquired in April 2017, was largely completed and considered a successful transition. OSMO’s leading edge technology is now embedded as part of our core value proposition and helps organisations automate the collection of data from large accounting / ERP systems.  We firmly believe we are well placed to exploit the opportunities that will arise from the ever-greater digitalisation of tax compliance and in compliance more generally. We look forward to the future with confidence. Annual General Meeting The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held on 20 June 2018 at 11 am at the offices of K&L Gates,
