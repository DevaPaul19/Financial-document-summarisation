A year on, this remains the  case. The team has worked extremely hard over the last two years on the  integration, which has completed one year ahead of schedule. This means  we can now give all our focus to pursuing opportunities to grow and take  share, prioritising long-term value creation, while delivering continued strong  cash generation and maintaining a robust balance sheet. Ours is a strategically  strong and well managed business which is positioned to address the  tougher trading environment forecast for the next few years.  Overview We achieved another year of record results and market outperformance,  driven by a good performance from the underlying business and an  additional seven-week contribution from Spirit. Group revenue grew 6.9%  to over £2.2bn, while operating profit before exceptional and non-underlying  items 1,2  increased by 4.9% to £411.5m. Profit before tax, exceptional and  non-underlying items 1,2  grew 6.6% to £273.5m, leading to a 1.3% increase  in adjusted earnings per share 1,2  to 70.8p.  Dividend Reflecting this performance and confidence in our long-term prospects,  the board has recommended a final dividend of 24.4p, giving a total dividend  for the year of 33.2p. This represents growth of 3.6% compared to last  year and continues the long-term track record of progressive dividends.  The board continues to target minimum dividend cover of around two  times earnings.  People We have 44,000 talented and hard-working team members. The continued  success of the business during the Spirit integration demonstrates the effort  they have put in over the last 12 months. I would like to take this opportunity  to thank everyone who has worked so hard during the last year helping us  to deliver these results at the same time as completing the integration of  Spirit ahead of schedule.  Board changes At the AGM in September 2016, Ian Durant retired from the board after  nine years, latterly as chairman of the audit committee. Rob Rowley took  over as audit chair at the same time. In December 2016, Gordon Fryett  joined the board bringing a wealth of experience of both retail and property  through his career at Tesco. I should like to record the board’s thanks to  Ian for his contribution to Greene King over such a critical period. Looking ahead We are excited about the opportunities we see in our core pub retailing  brands, where the results from our brand conversions are showing very  positive sales uplifts. We will continue with the programme over the coming  years, ensuring our pubs remain attractive and relevant to our customers  as they face into the challenges that the economic uncertainties will  undoubtedly bring.  Within the pub sector, Greene King’s combination of brands, teams and  assets leaves us well placed to deliver long-term growth and returns to  shareholders. Uncertainty affecting both business and consumer confidence  is likely to continue following the recent
