During 2017, the Group has made very  promising progress in the development of its MEX-GOL, SV  and VAS gas and condensate fields in north-eastern Ukraine,  with significant improvements in production rates, leading to   a much improved financial performance.  At the Group’s MEX-GOL and SV fields, production was  reasonably stable during the first half of 2017, but in June  2017, the new MEX-109 well, utilising improved drilling  and completion techniques developed as a result of recent  studies, was completed successfully and put on production,  and in August 2017, following completion of its workover,  the SV-2 well was also put on production. Together, these  successes have nearly doubled output from the MEX-GOL  and SV fields. In addition, the VAS field has continued to  produce consistently during the year. With the improved  contribution from the new wells on the MEX-GOL and SV  fields, aggregate production at the end of 2017 from all fields  was approximately 2,800 boepd. This compares with an  aggregate production rate of approximately 1,700 boepd at  the end of 2016, which represents an increase of nearly 65%  over the year. The fiscal and economic situation in Ukraine continues  to improve, with a better economic outlook, GDP growth  and improved stability in the Ukrainian Hryvnia exchange  rates, although the inflation rate did increase moderately.  Nevertheless, there continue to be stresses in the economy  and weaknesses in the Ukrainian banking sector. The Ukrainian Government has implemented a number of  reforms in the oil and gas industry in recent years, which  include the deregulation of the gas supply market in late 2015,  and more recently, reductions in the subsoil tax rates relating  to oil and gas production and a proposed simplification of the  regulatory procedures applicable to oil and gas exploration  and production activities in Ukraine.  The deregulation of the gas supply market, supported  by electronic gas trading platforms and improved pricing  transparency, has meant that the market gas prices in Ukraine  now broadly correlate with the imported gas prices. During  2017, gas prices were reasonably stable, allowing for some  seasonal variation, and were higher than in 2016. Furthermore,  condensate and LPG prices were also higher in 2017 by  comparison with the previous year. As regards the Group’s financial performance in the year  ended 31 December 2017, I am pleased to report that  the Group made a profit of $2.3 million (2016: $1.3 million  loss), mainly as a result of improved revenues from higher  production volumes and hydrocarbon prices. Cash generated  from operations during the year was higher at $18.0 million  (2016: $10.0 million).  Board and Management Changes During the year, there were significant changes to the  management and Board of Directors of the Company. With  effect from the start of August 2017, Sergii Glazunov became  Chief Executive Officer, having previously
