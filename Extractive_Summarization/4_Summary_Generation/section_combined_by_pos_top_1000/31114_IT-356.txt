Diluted earnings per share increased by over 6% to 1.04p (2016: 0.97p). Strategy The Group’s strategy remains to develop and operate scalable software platforms by serving global markets with domain names and related services. It continues to identify and exploit high growth areas within the domain industry, retaining a leading role in new Top-Level Domains, servicing country code domains, and focusing on growth markets including Eastern Europe and Asia. The Group aims to win and retain well-resourced clients with complementary objectives and to make acquisitions which meet the clear strategic criteria of being earnings accretive in the short term with a strong recurring revenue base, high quality of earnings, and high cash conversion. Management and Board As part of the strategy to build a diversified business of size and scale, the management team was strengthened to support the Group’s ambitions. In May 2017, Sarah Ryan joined CentralNic as Group Corporate Development Director, following the previous year’s senior hires of Stuart Fuller and Andy Churley as Group Commercial Director and Group Marketing Director respectively. The Board itself was strengthened further in July 2017 with the appointment of Don Baladasan as Chief Financial Officer, bringing considerable financial expertise in buy-and-build strategies and risk management. In August 2017 Desleigh Jameson, who joined the Group in January 2016 when it acquired Instra Corporation, stepped down from the Board. The integration of Instra’s operations in to the Group was by that time complete following Desleigh’s hard work in very quickly merging the highly successful Instra business in to the ever-expanding CentralNic. I would like to thank all members of the CentralNic team for their professionalism and commitment to the ongoing growth and transformation of the business. It is thanks to our staff, to our clients and to our distribution channel partners, as well as to our shareholders, that the Group continues to maintain and enhance its industry-leading position. Outlook Our vision is to join the ranks of world leaders in the industry. CentralNic strives to achieve this by continuing to disrupt existing markets and by identifying and exploiting key growth markets around the world. Moreover, ongoing consolidation in the domain services industry presents step-change acquisition opportunities for the Group to enter new markets and broaden its
