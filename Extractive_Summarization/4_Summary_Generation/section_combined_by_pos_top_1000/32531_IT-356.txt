It has been a year of structural, operational  and strategic transition for the Group. We  have a new and energised senior executive  team led by Ian Barkshire and Gavin Hill.  They have acted with impressive decisiveness  in embedding a number of changes in our  operating teams to raise the talent bar across  our business. We have also made good progress in  developing and implementing the new  Horizon strategy to reposition our Group  for long‑term sustainable growth. This has  seen some significant actions to manage  our portfolio of businesses with the aim of  accelerating our delivery of shareholder value.  In November, we announced the disposal of  our underperforming wire business, Oxford  Superconducting Technology, and since the  year end, we have announced the agreed sale  of our Industrial Analysis business to Hitachi  High‑Technologies.  Chairman’s Statement As Ian Barkshire sets out in his Chief  Executive’s Review, the management  team is now implementing the next phase  of the Horizon strategy to continue the  transformation of Oxford Instruments. This is  focused around the two anchors of returning  to sustainable growth and improving margins  by concentrating on market segments with  long‑term growth drivers where we have  the potential to become the market leader. The business delivered a stable performance in line   with our expectations against an extremely challenging  market backdrop. We have made good  progress in developing  and implementing the  new Horizon strategy.

The business  delivered a stable performance in line with  our expectations against an extremely  challenging market backdrop of slower  academic funding in the US and Europe and  the anticipated deterioration in the financial  performance of our OI Healthcare business.  Our NanoTechnology Tools sector performed  strongly and we saw good returns from the  servicing of our own products. These growth  businesses provide the platform for our  future growth. Adjusted basic earnings per share on a  continuing basis grew by 5.5%. However,  taking into account the impact on the Group  of business disposals, currency effects and  our progressive strengthening of the balance  sheet, the Board has proposed to hold the  dividend at last year’s level.
