Our results refer to ‘adjusted’ results alongside our statutory results, which we believe will be more useful to readers since we manage our business using adjusted measures.  The directors believe that exceptional items and adjustments impair visibility of the underlying performance of the Group’s businesses and, accordingly, these are excluded  from our non-GAAP measures of revenue, profit before tax, EBITDA, operating profit and adjusted earnings per share, which we use in internal reports. www.rank.com | 3 - Our brands Delivering  through our brands Group brands at a glance More information Operating review – Grosvenor Casinos 32 Operating review – Mecca 34 Operating review – Luda 34 Operating review – UK Digital 35 Contribution to group revenue 1 £755.1m Grosvenor 397.2 Mecca 213.6 UK digital 111.5 Enracha 32.8 Operating profit 2 £83.5m Grosvenor 52.1 Mecca 29.9 UK digital 22.7 Enracha 6.2 Customer numbers 3,4 2,824k Grosvenor 1,350 Mecca 947 UK digital 400 Enracha 275 1 Before customer incentives. 2 Before exceptional items. 3 Unaudited. 4 Excluding customer cross over of 148k.
