The Board sees this  area and specialist CRO services such as  orphan drug development as significant  opportunities where Ergomed can take  global leadership positions and continue  to grow. The appointment of Stephen Stamp as CEO and Dr Jan  Petracek as COO was a catalyst for the re-aligned Board to  review Ergomed’s growth opportunities and set strategic  priorities which will see greater focus on the services business  and a targeting of the Company’s resources at those areas. The co-development pipeline continues to represent a  differentiator for the CRO business and is a source of  potential upside but with increased focus on the services  business, expansion of the pipeline will not be a strategic  priority. Having delivered strong Phase II clinical trial results  for PeproStat, the Company intends to pursue further  development of the Haemostatix assets through partnerships  and collaborations. The integration of pharmacovigilance services under the  PrimeVigilance brand, which commenced during 2017, was  successfully completed in 2018 and the acquisition of PSR, a  specialist orphan CRO, contribute to a firm foundation for the  Company’s strategic priorities.  I look forward to further progress this year and in the future.
