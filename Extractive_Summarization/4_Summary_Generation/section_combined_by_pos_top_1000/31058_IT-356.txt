  112 Glossary 01 Hurricane Energy plc Annual Report and Group Financial Statements Year Ended 31 December 2017 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements About us  Hurricane is new generation of oil company  that exists to discover, appraise and develop  oil from fractured basement reservoirs.  Fractured basements are a global  phenomenon which have been produced  successfully for extended periods in multiple  locations around the world. However, in  the UK they represent a new play type  for a sector of the oil industry which has  historically focused on sandstone reservoirs.  Hurricane is the first oil company to target  fractured basements in the region. Unlike sandstone reservoirs, which hold oil  in pores in the rock, fractured basement  reservoirs are composed of very hard rocks  such as granite, with the oil held in the  fractures that have formed over the past   2.5 billion years.  Where we operate  Hurricane has a portfolio of contiguous  offshore licences on the UK Continental  Shelf, to the west of Shetland.  The area is a proven petroleum basin with  a number of large producing oil fields  including Clair, Foinaven and Schiehallion.  Hurricane’s licences are focussed on the  Rona Ridge, a major NE-SW trending  basement feature. The water depth in the  area is around 150 metres. All licences are  owned 100%. Extensive exploration and appraisal work  programmes have led to a number of  significant discoveries in the Company’s  acreage, including Lancaster, Whirlwind,  Lincoln, and Halifax.  What we do  Technically led and driven, we use our  expertise to find oil where others have  looked but not seen. We make and exploit  discoveries, working towards realising the  value of those discoveries.  Hurricane has drilled eight wells on its  acreage since 2009 including five on the  Lancaster field. Hurricane is now working towards the  first phase of development of its Rona  Ridge assets, the Lancaster EPS. Extended  production will provide data to improve  understanding of the reservoir to be applied  across the Company’s portfolio in further  appraisal activity.  The first phase of development of Lancaster  is an Early Production System (EPS). This  involves tying two existing wells back to the  Aoka Mizu Floating Production Storage and  Offloading (FPSO) vessel. The Bluewater- owned Aoka Mizu previously operated on  the Blackbird and Ettrick fields in the North  Sea and requires only limited upgrades and  life extension to be used on Lancaster. The EPS is key to delivering the reservoir  information required to move to full field  development.  It’s objectives are to: •  Provide long-term production data to  enhance understanding of reservoir  characteristics and associated full field  development scenarios •  Commence development of resources in  phased manner with regard to managing  uncertainties over reservoir characteristics  and associated development risks • Deliver an acceptable return on investment H1 2019 1 7 ,000bopd 6 years 100% At a Glance Our West of Shetland portfolio of discoveries   is now moving towards development with the   Lancaster Early Production System as the first phase.

As fractured basement reservoirs have  not previously been exploited in the UK, Hurricane has determined  that it will need to maintain ownership of its assets for longer, and  at greater levels, than is typical in more common reservoir types in  the region. The Company believes that this approach will allow it to  optimise the value it obtains for its discovered resources.  Implementation of Hurricane’s strategy has led to a focus on the  Company’s Lancaster field, which is now the best understood asset in  its portfolio, following five wells drilled by Hurricane. The Company  plans to bring the Lancaster field to commercial production, in  an initial development phase, the EPS. This allows uncertainties  associated with the reservoir to be removed whilst commencing a  phased development and generating cash flow.  The Company believes that it will achieve the best value for its asset  base by progressing the portfolio as a whole. It will therefore explore  and appraise its other assets in the surrounding
