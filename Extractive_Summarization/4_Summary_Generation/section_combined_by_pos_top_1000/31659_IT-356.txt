LightwaveRF plc  Strategic report  Chairman’s statement   for the year ended 30 September 2017  ________________________________________________________________________________  - 4 - I am pleased to be able to report on considerable progress made by your company during the last year.  Overview  During 2017, revenue more than doubled. We further extended and developed our UK distribution capability,  expanded our direct to market sales and successfully established a technology and distribution relationship with  Apple. Post year end we also completed our largest fundraising to date, which saw us add two major institutional  investors to the shareholder list.   We have built on the progress of the previous year with more market awareness, distribution led sales and through  ensuring Lightwave products and technology continue to develop. In addition, we have developed our direct sales  capability, supported by a dedicated customer services function. The smart home market is now becoming more  clearly defined, which is helping Lightwave better communicate its proposition and capability.   Offering access to the Lightwave platform either directly or through Amazon, Apple and Google as well as the growth  of voice control, opens up many opportunities for the business. The broad challenge as ever will be to ensure we  prioritise our strategic goals so that we bridge the gap between short term achievements and the long-term ambition  to build a scaled business in the smart home sector.   We are continuing to strengthen our management and technology capability. As well as welcoming new chief  executive, Andrew Pearson, to the board in March, we have broadened our teams’ skill sets with the addition of new  staff. This is all directed to putting solid building blocks in place for the much larger business we aim to create. I would  like to take the opportunity to thank our staff, our suppliers and subcontractors for the effort they have applied during  the year to achieve a further step change for the business.   Financials  Revenue for the 2017 financial year was £3.03 million, more than double last year (2016: £1.44 million). Gross margins  further improved to 35.5% (2016: 32.5%) benefiting from the growth of direct sales. Administrative expenses were up  to £2.12 million (2016: £1.49 million) as we spent more on marketing, research and development. Capitalised  development expenditure was £0.69 million (2016: £0.51 million) in accordance with IAS38, reflecting the  commitment to the development of our Generation 2 technology and devices. The loss before and after tax was £0.85  million (2016: £0.84 million).   Our balance sheet has now been considerably strengthened through our post financial year end fundraising, giving a  strong and stable foundation upon which to develop our business. The pro-forma group statement of equity after this  fundraising is as follows:  2017  As reported  £m  Net funding  proceeds  £m  Pro forma  £m  Total shareholders’ equity 1.23 4.90 6.13    LightwaveRF plc  Strategic report  Chairman’s statement (continued)  for the year ended 30 September 2017      ________________________________________________________________________________  - 5 -  Outlook  Completing a two-year long process of technology development which has met the exacting criteria of Apple and  other major companies has been a major achievement for a small company. We now have the funds in place to further  strengthen our management capability, marketing and sales as well as continuing to ensure our technology remains  at the forefront of the smart home revolution.  We very much look forward to upping the pace of our progress through 2018.           Barry Gamble
