Diurnal has identified a number of such needs within the field of  endocrinology, which the Group believes represents a multi-billion  Dollar combined market opportunity . Diurnal is able to gain valuable  insights into the burden of living with these diseases through our  interaction with physicians and patient groups. These discussions  have helped, and continue to help, shape the Group’s development  plans, such that we can deliver products that not only address  important unmet needs and improve patients’ lives but also have  a positive impact on healthcare budgets. Investing for development and value creation During the year, Diurnal continued to make significant clinical  development progress with its late-stage pipeline products, as  well as establishing commercial operations in anticipation of  future product launches. Infacort ®  and Chronocort ®  are in  late-stage clinical development targeting indications of cortisol  deficiency: Infacort ®  has completed a Phase III clinical trial and  has been submitted for marketing authorisation in Europe, and  Chronocort ®  is currently undergoing a Phase III clinical trial  for Europe. The Group has put in place strong commercial  infrastructure in Europe to support the planned launch of  Infacort ® , for which the Group anticipates receiving market  authorisation in Europe towards the end of 2017 , at which stage  development costs will begin to be capitalised in accordance  with International Accountancy Standards (IAS). The Group plans  to leverage its investment in the commercial team through the  timely introduction of Chronocort ®  following completion of  the ongoing European Phase III clinical trial and regulatory review,  expected around the end of 2019. The Group also remains  mindful of external growth opportunities and continues to  assess endocrinology assets that fit within its disease focus.  The US remains a key market for Diurnal and the Group intends  to progress the Phase III development of both Infacort ®  and  Chronocort ®  in this region during the new financial year, whilst  assessing the optimal commercialisation strategy, in parallel. As planned, the funds raised at the IPO have allowed the Group  to continue to build its team, and we have been able to attract  highly skilled individuals across the organisation. The agreement  with Ashfield Healthcare, announced during the year, has facilitated  a rapid and efficient build-out of our European commercial  organisation without the need to undertake costly upfront  investment in infrastructure in each of our key territories. I am  pleased to see that the Ashfield team has integrated seamlessly  with Diurnal staff and are rapidly implementing our launch plans. Diurnal also continues to invest in its earlier-stage pipeline, with  good progress being made with the Group’s oral native testosterone  product, which entered human clinical trials during the year,  as well as our programmes in Cushing’s Disease (cortisol excess)  and hypothyroidism.  Meeting milestones, building our future Chairman’s statement It is with great pleasure that I report on the  significant progress Diurnal has made this  financial year towards becoming a world-leading,  endocrinology-focused specialty pharma  company. Most notable is the delivery of key  milestones towards first commercial revenues.  Through this period of development, Diurnal has  maintained its entrepreneurial and patient-centric  approach, which has enabled the progression of a  valuable portfolio of novel prospects and provides  a solid platform for our future development. 3  Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017 Board changes and governance Diurnal strengthened its Board during the year with the  appointment of Richard Bungay as Chief Financial Officer.
