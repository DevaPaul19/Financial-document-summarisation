Nexus Infrastructure plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017 3 Strategic report Governance Financial statements I am pleased to report a robust set of results   for the year ended 30 September 2017. Chairman’s statement This is our maiden set of results as  a public company, following the  Company’s successful Initial Public  Offering (“IPO”) on the London Stock  Exchange’s Alternative Investment  Market (“AIM”) in July 2017. I would  like to take this opportunity to  welcome all our new shareholders.  Overview of the year The Nexus business model, with  Tamdown’s well-established market  position as a leading provider of  essential infrastructure services  to the UK’s largest housebuilders,  coupled with TriConnex’s growing  utilities connection services, was  resilient during a challenging year.  As previously reported, the EU  Referendum caused a slowdown  in tendering activity and delays to  customers awarding new contracts  during the second half of 2016  with a corresponding delay to work  commencing on site. In spite of  this market backdrop, the Group  is reporting revenue for the year  of £135.0m (2016: £135.7m), and  an operating profit of £9.3m  (2016: £10.4m). As at 30 September  2017, the order book was at a record  level of £202.7m up 25% from  £161.7m in 2016, providing good  earnings visibility for the year ahead.

The Group’s strategy is to  deliver outstanding performance  through a focus on innovation and  customer service which will lead to  growth, building on existing market  positions by developing new markets  and services whilst extending  geography, both organically and  through complementary earnings  enhancing acquisitions.  The Group’s organic growth strategy  is focused on four key drivers:  increasing market share within  current geographies, expanding  into new geographies, diversification  into new growth sectors and  leveraging customer relationships  to enhance cross-selling within the  Group. In addition to organic growth,  further growth will come from the  successful sourcing, execution and  integration of chosen acquisitions.  The Group is taking a disciplined  approach to acquisitions, seeking  to enhance shareholder value with  acquisitions that are linked or closely  associated with TriConnex, such as  businesses within existing residential  utility or non-residential utilities  markets or new markets, such as  continuing to develop our fibre and  Electric Vehicle charging services.  Returns to shareholders As a listed company, one of our  primary objectives is to deliver  increased shareholder value over  time. The Board has adopted a
