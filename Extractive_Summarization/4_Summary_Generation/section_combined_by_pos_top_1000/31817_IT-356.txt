Head office Manchester, UK Manufacturing Runcorn, UK Business development USA Business development Korea Japan Taiwan 04 Strategic report Introduction It is a pleasure to introduce Nanoco’s results for  the year to 31 July 2017. This has been a challenging  year, with slower than anticipated adoption of the  Company’s cadmium-free quantum dots (“CFQDs”)  in the display industry. However, significant progress  has been made in developing demand for our  CFQDs; an increasing number of manufacturers are  now producing demonstration displays incorporating  our technology and we are confident that sales will  result as these move into commercial production.  We are also making good progress in Life sciences  and Specialised lighting. The slower than expected  progress in Display and the Company’s funding  horizon have both had a detrimental impact on  the Company’s share price. I am pleased to say  that the recent announcement of an equity  placing has alleviated liquidity concerns.  MAKING STRONG  PROGRESS CHAIRMAN’ S S TATEMENT I am confident about the relevance of our technology  in display and other markets. Summary  • An increasing number of manufacturers  are now producing demonstration displays  incorporating our technology.  • We now have the supply chain and the  technology to support the development  of the emerging market in CFQDs for  the display industry. STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 05 Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Following the change in commercial strategy in  the previous financial year, substantial changes  were made in the business during this year, which  have created the building blocks for future commercial  success. The Company has a compelling go-to-market  strategy, with a partnership with Taiwan’s Wah Hong  Industrial Corporation (“Wah Hong”), alongside its  two licensees, The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”)  and Merck KGaA (“Merck”). These routes to market  are supported by the Company’s own manufacturing  facility in Runcorn. We now have the supply chain  and the technology to support the development of  the emerging market in CFQDs for the display industry.  The recent move by the European Commission to ban  cadmium in displays in Europe from 31 October 2019
