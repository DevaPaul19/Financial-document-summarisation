The Group  has also made good progress towards its  strategic objectives and in particular, by  achieving underlying ROCE of 18.4% in  the year, ahead of target. Group revenue for the year was £271.2m,  15.0% higher than the prior year on a  reported basis, 10.6% higher on a constant  currency basis and 4.1% higher on a like  for like constant currency basis. Underlying  operating profit at £23.8m was 11.7% higher  than the prior year, mainly reflecting a further  significant improvement in performance in  our South African business, and a first‑time  contribution from Abode which was acquired  in March 2016. Underlying diluted earnings  per share was consistent with the previous  year at 27.8p. The recent acquisitions of Croydex and  Abode have been integrated seamlessly  into the Norcros Group and are performing  in line with the Board’s expectations. I have  been encouraged by the quality and  enthusiasm of the management teams  of those businesses in identifying and  pursuing opportunities in collaboration  with the Group’s existing portfolio, particularly  in the areas of new business development,  procurement and supply chain. The Group has again delivered a strong  cash performance, with underlying  operating cash flow at 99% of underlying  EBITDA (2016: 76%). The Group is in a  sound financial position with a strong  balance sheet and has reduced net debt  by £9.3m to £23.2m (2016: £32.5m),  representing leverage of 0.8 times  underlying EBITDA.
