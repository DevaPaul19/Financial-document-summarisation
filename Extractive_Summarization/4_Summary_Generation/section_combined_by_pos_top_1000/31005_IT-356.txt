Underlying performance differs from the statutory  IFRS performance as it excludes the effect of Special Items, which are detailed in note 3. The Board’s view is that Underlying performance provides additional clarity for  the Group’s investors and so it is the primary focus of the Group’s narrative reporting. Where appropriate, IFRS performance inclusive of Special Items is also described.  References to ‘unit margin’ and ‘margin’ are used in the commentary on Underlying performance. Unit margin (or margin) is calculated on selling price less variable raw  material and logistics costs. Further explanations can be found in notes 4, 5 and 6.
