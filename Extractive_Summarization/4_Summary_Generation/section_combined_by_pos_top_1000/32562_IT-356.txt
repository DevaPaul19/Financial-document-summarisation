U and I Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 “OUR PERFORMANCE  OVER THE PAST YEAR  HIGHLIGHTS THE EXTENT  OF OUR AMBITIONS   AND OUR POTENTIAL   FOR THE FUTURE”  We are highly ambitious, not for ambition’s sake, but  because we are clear about the need for the regeneration   projects we create. We are proud of our ability to deliver  them and we understand the value, both financial and  social, that can be generated from them.  As our business expands and develops, the combination  of our operational focus and our financial model will  deliver consistent, long-term value, driven by a dynamic  blend of development, trading and investment activity.

We realise gains and drive value as we unlock the  potential of land and assets.  We have a talent for buying well and delivering value through  planning and development. We focus on opportunities where  our size and expertise afford us competitive advantage. We  are experts in managing the complexities of the planning system  to deliver high quality, mixed-use regeneration projects.  With a track record of over 25 years of investment and  development, and a diverse team of property experts, our   £6 billion portfolio contains a mixture of longer-term large- scale regeneration projects, shorter-term trading  opportunities and investment assets (see pages 22 to 39).  This combination of projects allows us to generate consistent  returns and income through the property cycles.  We have an equity-efficient approach to development, whereby  we limit our financial exposure through the Public Private   Partnership (PPP) model (see pages 28 to 31). This reduces  our risk exposure in any one individual project whilst allowing  us to build a portfolio with significant upside potential. Our activity is focused on three core geographical areas – the  London City Region*, Manchester and Dublin – where we  see liquidity and sufficient depth through the cycle as well as  growth in demand. These locations have the talent, tenants  and tourism to succeed.  Placing people at the heart of everything we do, we are  committed to delivering profitable projects that create a legacy  and deliver socio-economic change for the communities in  which we work (see pages 48 to 54).
