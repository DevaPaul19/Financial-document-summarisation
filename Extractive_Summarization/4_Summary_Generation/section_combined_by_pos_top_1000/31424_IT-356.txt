Michael Cunningham Non-executive Chairman Summary • Loss before tax and impairment of  £406,000 (2016 profit: £1,336,000) • Adjusted net asset value at  £1.60 per share (2016: £1.96)  • Five acquisitions in 2017 added  £4.4m of capacity to 2017  underwriting year – 13% increase • 1.5p per share total dividend  payable (2016: 5.5p) Your Board announces the results for 2017  which were affected by the underwriting losses  arising from natural catastrophes that occurred  in 2017 and by the reduction in the value of  the syndicate portfolio of capacity. The loss  before impairment for the year is £406,000  (2016 profit: £1,334,000), whilst the adjusted  net asset value of the Group is £1.60 per share  (2016: £1.96). The full impact of the 2017 losses on the Helios  portfolio of £5.8m was mitigated by the use  of quota share and stop loss reducing the net  loss for 2017 to £1.9m. Underwriting profits from the two older  underwriting years, the “off-risk” years, made  a good contribution but the 2017 underwriting  year in its first 12 months recognised a  significant loss following the series of natural  catastrophes in the second half of 2017.  Other income arising from fees from  reinsurers, recoveries from reinsurance  policies and investment income have  contributed to this year results. Total  costs of £1.8m included the expenditure  on protecting the portfolio using stop loss  reinsurance and foreign exchange losses  from the strengthening of the US$. Strategy The building of a portfolio of participations on  leading Lloyd’ s syndicates remains the strategic  objective of the Group. During 2017 the key  developments were: • building the portfolio of capacity to £41m  for 2018 by acquiring a further five limited  liability vehicles (“LLVs”); • maintaining the quality of the portfolio  and the outperformance of the underwriting  results average against the Lloyd’s market  as a whole; • continuing to use quota share reinsurance  to reduce the risk from the underwriting  and to assist in the financing of the  underwriting capital of the portfolio; and • broadening the access to the portfolio  to private capital by using a protected  cell reinsurance structure. Capacity acquired During 2017 a further five corporate members were acquired that increased the capacity for  the 2015 to 2017 years of account as shown below. Year of account – £m 2015 2016 2017 2018 Capacity at 1 January 2017 32.2 33.7 32.6 41.0 Acquired during 2017 4.1 4.1 4.4 —  Capacity at 31 December 2017 36.3 37.8 37.0 41.0 These five acquisitions in 2017 were purchased  for a total consideration of £4.8m, of which  £2.1m was attributed to the value of capacity  acquired. Given the uncertainty generated as  to valuation of LLVs in the second half of the  year arising from the natural catastrophes,  the flow of potential acquisitions slowed.  With prospective 2017 underwriting year  losses and the reduction in the value of  capacity, there is the prospect of acquiring  further LLVs in the future at lower prices.  We will continue to build on the quality of the  capacity portfolio as it is essential to acquire  and retain the participations on the better  managed
