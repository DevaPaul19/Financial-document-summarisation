At a glance 2 Lombard Risk Management plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Chairman’s statement SUMMARY • The Group achieved revenue  growth of 44.8%, giving a  five-year compound annual  growth rate of 21.9%. • The Group raised £7.9m net  during the year via a placing and  open offer to support its strategy. • The Group invested in its  products and launched a  new technology development  centre in Birmingham. • The Board remains confident  in our plans and our ability to  continue to execute them. The Board is very pleased with the progress  made in delivering the Group’s two-year plan. Philip Crawford Non-executive Chairman I am pleased to report on a year  of substantial growth and investment  for Lombard Risk Management plc  (“Lombard Risk”), underpinned by the  injection of new equity through the  placing and open offer that we closed  in June and July of 2016 and which was  well supported by our shareholders. Results The Group achieved revenue growth  of 44.8%, giving a five-year compound  annual growth rate of 21.9%. Recurring  revenues grew by 21.0% to £12.4m  (2016: £10.2m) and revenues from  new licences and renewals of expiring  term licences grew by 113.7% to £11.6m  (2016: £5.4m). The Group raised £7.9m  net during the year via a placing and open  offer to support its plans for increased  investment in its products and the launch  of a new technology development centre  in Birmingham, and as a result of this  continued investment, the Group has  recorded a loss before tax of £1.6m  (2016: £2.2m). Net cash as at the year  end stood at £7.0m (2016: £3.3m).  Dividend The Group suspended its progressive  dividend policy in the year ended  31 March 2016 and it remains the view  of the Board that the Group’s resources  are best directed towards the exploitation  of the considerable opportunities that  continue to present themselves in both  the regulatory reporting and collateral  management software markets. The Board  does not therefore recommend the  payment of a dividend.  Strategy The support of our shareholders in  both the placing and open offer closed  during the year has enabled the Group
