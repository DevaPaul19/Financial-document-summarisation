 Progress Highlights Financial highlights Deliver a safe, efficient and reliable  service every day  > The volume of flights we handled increased by 7.6% to 2.45 million   (2016: 2.28 million). We maintained our safety record, with no risk- bearing Airprox 3  attributable to NATS (2016: nil).   > Average en route delay per flight increased to 10.9 seconds (2016: 4.3   seconds), reflecting in part higher than expected traffic. We enabled  additional annual savings for airline customers of 55,900 tonnes of  CO 2 emissions. Deliver SESAR and transform the  business for the future  > We consulted customers on our revised investment plan for RP2,  which accelerates the deployment of SESAR technology.  > Important milestones included: implementation of our new flight data  processor (iTEC 4 ) into Prestwick upper airspace, and live trials of  electronic flights strips by the Terminal Control (TC) operation. Win and retain commercial business  > We were awarded ATC and engineering contracts by George   Best Belfast City Airport and an airspace design contract for   Thailand. FerroNATS secured ATC contracts at three additional  Spanish airports.  > We renewed ATC contracts with Aberdeen, Glasgow and  Southampton and extended our ATC contract with Luton for one  year. We also renewed the engineering service with Highlands  and Islands Airports.   > Edinburgh Airport’s ATC service will transfer to a competitor in  March 2018. Other priorities for 2016/17  > We invested in April 2017 in Searidge Technologies, a provider of  technology for remote tower services and continue to develop a  remotely-operated airport control tower capability at Swanwick.  > We are supporting Aquila with the MOD’s Project Marshall and we  have formed a task force with our partner, Thales, to re-plan the  delivery of the asset provision milestones.

While  Airspace customers benefited from real price  reductions under the RP2 Performance Plan, the related reductions in  revenue were more than offset by additional revenue from the increase  in flights handled. This year we safely handled an additional 7.6% of flights. This growth   was much higher than assumed in our RP2 Performance Plan set when  jet fuel prices were much higher than today and flights were projected  to grow by only 2%. We also generated additional income from  supporting the UK military with Project Marshall, which helped to offset  lower Airports income. Profit before tax and goodwill impairment, at £137m (2016: £137m)  was in line with last year. After taking into account a reduced charge  for goodwill impairment of £11m (2016: £93m), profit before tax at   £126m (2016: £44m) was £82m better. The Board has reviewed the group’s dividend policy. This now aims  to pay a regular and progressive dividend that reflects NERL’s cost of  equity (as reflected in the RP2 Performance Plan) and any regulatory  out-performance as well as a pay-out of 25% of profit after tax for  NATS Services. In addition, from time to time the Board will consider  the potential for, and affordability of, returning any excess capital to  shareholders taking into account NERL’s gearing and the overall  liabilities of the NATS group. The Board paid dividends of £24.0m in 2017 (2016: £81.7m). In May   2017, the group paid a first interim dividend of £28.5m for the 2018   financial year.  NATS Holdings Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report   |  08 Progress Defined benefit pension scheme The Trustees’ 2015 triennial valuation reported an increase in the deficit  to £459m (2012 triennial valuation: £383m). As a result, the group  has agreed to increase its contributions to the scheme and expects  to meet this increase through an adjustment to NERL’s prices in the  next Performance Plan period (based on the EU performance scheme  regulations) and from NATS Services’ operating cash flows. The Trustees intend to bring forward their next valuation to 31 December  2017. This will help inform NERL’s Initial Performance Plan for the  next regulatory reference period (RP3: 2020-2024) on which we will be  consulting customers and other stakeholders from spring 2018. UK’s EU referendum decision While the outcome of the UK’s EU referendum decision and the  triggering of Article 50 has not had an adverse impact on the demand  for air travel to date, it has potentially significant implications for the UK  aviation sector.  The company has provided input to the Department for Transport (DfT)  on the regulation of Air Traffic Management (ATM) after Brexit. In our  view the logical outcome is for the UK to re-establish national economic  regulation of UK ATM and to retain control of this critical part of the UK’s  national infrastructure. This would avoid the complexity and cost of  having two regulators (the European Commission and the CAA)  and enable NATS to be more
