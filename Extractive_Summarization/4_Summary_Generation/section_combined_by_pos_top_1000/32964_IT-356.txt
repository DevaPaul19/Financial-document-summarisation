In 2017 Genel delivered  on that potential. I am now more confident than ever that,  while challenges remain, there is material  upside in the Genel portfolio and significant  opportunities ahead. As we enter 2018,  I believe that we have both the right strategy  to take advantage of these and the right  management team to deliver on that strategy. The macroeconomic climate altered again in  2017. On the positive side, the increase in the  oil price helped to boost cash flows from our  producing assets, and also provided a more  solid basis for the economy of the Kurdistan  Region of Iraq (‘KRI’). The unfortunate events  in the KRI in the last quarter of the year and  the subsequent material reduction in KRG  exports caused by these events significantly  disrupted the status quo. However, despite the  decrease in oil exports, the KRG continued to  demonstrate its ability and willingness to make  payments, and Genel has received payments  for sales on a monthly basis since September  2015. This has enabled investment by the  Company to continue. Financial strength  underpinning opportunity Genel is currently on a sound financial  footing, and continues to generate significant  free cash flow, something boosted by  the signing of the Receivable Settlement  Agreement (‘RSA’) in August 2017. The  successful refinancing in December then  provided a bedrock from which we can move  forward with a proactive growth strategy. There are exciting opportunities available  for cash-generative, proactive companies,  and the Board and management carried out  a comprehensive review of Genel strategy in  order to define a clear and focused roadmap  to creating significant shareholder value. The  refreshed strategy focuses on the creation  of shareholder value, providing growth  opportunities while retaining a firm focus  on prudent financial planning.  Our strategy builds on our core strengths –  a robust and cash-generative asset portfolio,  technical and commercial expertise, and our  ability to leverage regional relationships and  manage risk in complex areas. These were  key drivers behind our excellent performance  in 2017. We have significant organic development  options within Genel’s KRI portfolio,  the financial ability to add assets to the  portfolio, and management with the skills  and experience to maximise the value of  these opportunities.  Focus on cost and capability Genel will continue to ensure that its cost  base reflects the external economic situation.  Total general and administrative cash costs  were more than halved from 2014 to 2016,  and the Company continues to ensure the  most appropriate structure and cost base  from which to grow and deliver maximum  value to stakeholders. In 2017 reductions  were made to remuneration at all levels,  and executive remuneration brought into  line with comparable listed E&P companies. Side by side with this focus on cost, is a  focus on operational capability. There has  been significant change at both Board and  management levels over the last twelve  months or so, and we have a high-quality  team working well together. As we go  forward, the Board will work to ensure  continuity at management level and provide  leadership on management succession. In 2017 we welcomed Tim Bushell and Martin  Gudgeon to the Board, adding relevant skills  and experience. Both have made a significant  contribution to the healthy dynamics and  strong processes confirmed by an external  board evaluation review carried out at the  end of 2017.  Despite changes to personnel, one thing  that has not changed has been the Company- wide focus on health, safety, and responsible  operations. Genel takes pride in its operations  and strives for positive community impact,  and it was pleasing to see a repeat of 2016’s  performance in achieving no lost-time  incidents, while reducing incidents of primary  containment loss to a single minor event.  I would like to thank all employees across  our operations for their ongoing vigilance  and hard work. Focus in 2018 We have a robust balance sheet, a clear  strategy, and the correct team to implement  it. Going through 2018 we look forward to  clearly setting out the growth potential that  this provides, and as such plan for active  capital market engagement. We appreciate the patience and confidence  that
