The Board places considerable emphasis on  corporate governance as it believes it will provide  the sustainable foundations for the continued   success and growth of the Group. The Board is  committed to building the Group’s corporate  governance framework to deliver the Group’s  strategic aims and performance. As we advised last year, a search was commenced  for an additional independent Channel Islands  based Director to Chair our new Risk Committee.  Details of how this search was carried out are in  the report of the Nomination and Governance  Committee on page 50. I am delighted that we were able to announce the  appointment of Mel Carvill in December 2017.  Mel joined the Board on 1 January 2018. UK Corporate   Governance Code SANNE as a premium listed company on the  London Stock Exchange is subject to the provisions  of the UK Corporate Governance Code published  by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in April  2016 (the Code). The Code is publicly available  at h ttp s://frc.org.uk/ge t att achmen t/ c a7e94c4- b9a9-49e2-a824-ad76a322873c/UK -Corporat e- Go vernanc e-Code-April-2016.pdf . With one exception, SANNE complied with the  Code throughout 2017. Between 1 January 2017  and 31 December 2017 the Group did not comply  with the provision that required at least half  of the Board to be independent Non-executive  Directors, excluding the Chairman. However,  following an extensive search Mel Carvill was  selected. Mel brings substantial financial services  experience and will provide great insight as we  strive to establish the Group as one of the leading  providers of alternative asset and corporate  administration services. Phil Godley also stepped down from the Board  on 1 January 2018 as an Executive Director and I  wish to thank Phil for his huge contribution to the  Board.   Following these changes, from 1 January 2018  SANNE has been compliant with the Code, with a  majority of independent Non-executive Directors  on the Board. Culture Good governance is at the heart of our business.  Our culture is one of transparency and openness  and we constantly seek to develop our governance  framework to take into account the Group’s  changing circumstances and developments in the  wider governance environment. Communications  have been delivered to the organisation  to reinforce the required standards and  professionalism throughout the business.  Diversity SANNE’s people are from wide and diverse  backgrounds, nationalities and ethnic and religious  groups. With continued global expansion, diversity  amongst our colleagues has and will continue  to increase as we foster international talent. We  respect cultural differences, and learn about and  embrace these differences in each territory in  which we operate. Details of our Board Diversity  policy can be found on our website at www. sannegroup.com. Our committees The Committees have an important role in  supporting the Board’s work. They are provided  with the resources they need to discharge their  role, including administration support and access  to professional advisers. Information about the  Committees can be found in this report on   pages 50 to 74. The Board has, as part of its role, focused on  our corporate governance and after discussions  agreed that the Nomination Committee extend its  brief to cover governance matters. Accordingly,  it was renamed the Nomination and Governance  Committee, and has new Terms of Reference,  which are available on our website. This  committee will keep a close watching brief on  governance developments and external guidance  and report to, and advise, the Board on all  relevant changes. In addition, it was agreed to have separate  Audit and Risk committees following our Board  evaluation last year. The new Risk Committee will  report to the Board through Mel. It will allow the  Group to have an enhanced focus on risk reporting  and monitoring. The Audit Committee, chaired  by Andy Pomfret, will continue to review SANNE’s  internal controls and risk management systems  and to manage our audit plans. We continually review our corporate governance  and the following report covers our approach and  provides insight into discussions held at the Board  and its Committees.
