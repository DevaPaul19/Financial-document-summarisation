Tyman has again demonstrated its resilience  in producing a solid set of results for 2017  and a further year of profitable growth,  assisted by increased contributions from  the Bilco and Giesse businesses purchased  in 2016 and by further margin expansion  in the enlarged SchlegelGiesse business.  These results were achieved despite the  Group encountering some challenges during  the year. Operational issues in Juarez, Mexico  took longer to resolve than expected, there  was some short term market share loss in  AmesburyTruth and subdued market conditions  continued in the United Kingdom.  In 2017, alongside its regular agenda items,  the Board has spent considerable time on  four key topics: how the Board operates,  succession planning, Group strategy and  health and safety. How the Board operates The Board conducted an externally facilitated  evaluation during the year, with a focus on  how the Board and its associated Committees  operate, the results of which are summarised  in the Corporate governance section on  pages 56 to 60. This exercise has proved useful  in that it confirmed the open and collegiate  culture of the Group Board while providing  specific direction for improvement of the  Board’s processes in the future. A solid set of results with good cash generation  demonstrating the Group’s resilience. Please join us on 10 May 2018 in  Wolverhampton to see first hand  how one of Tyman’s Divisions is  delivering our commitment to  operational excellence.” Martin Towers Non-executive Chairman Martin Towers Non-executive Chairman Find out more at: www.tymanplc.com 07 Board priorities 2017 has seen the Board focus on four  key areas: • How the Board operates  • Succession planning • Group strategy • Health and safety  Find out more about governance    on Pages 56 to 60 As in previous years the Board continued with  its established practice of spending time with  Divisional management and employees away
