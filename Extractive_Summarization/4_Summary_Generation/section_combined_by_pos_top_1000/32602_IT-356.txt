This demographic tends to be  wealthier and more resilient during  times of economic uncertainty. Our  customer insight allows us to gain  unique insight into the traits of   our target demographic, helping us   to develop products and services   that we know will be valuable to our  customers. We operate across sectors  which provide services that people   need. This means that demand for   our products and services remains  consistent amongst a customer   base that predominantly spends   unearned income. The model works The Group has an excellent track  record of delivering consistent earnings  growth. The capital efficiency of the  model means that we are highly cash  generative. This enables us to invest for  future growth, whilst continuing to pay  down debt and enhance long-term  returns to shareholders through our  progressive dividend policy.  Confidence in future delivery Our existing strategy is robust. The  in-depth work we have undertaken   to deepen our understanding of our  customers has provided the logical   next step in the evolution of our model.  We are now in a position to use our  enhanced insight and data capability  through a membership structure to  become a more efficient organisation,  ensuring that we: • retain and deepen our customer  relationships; • increase new customer targeting; and • generate increased profits at lower  risk, with lower capital. This strategic evolution increases our  confidence in our ability to generate  consistent long-term earnings growth  on a sustainable basis. Saga as an investment Why invest in us? ...to deliver profit and dividend   growth, strong cash generation   and sustainable shareholder return. Strategic report Governance Financial statements ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC 3 Strategic report Chairman’s statement Our focus on customer needs   has been the driving force behind   the growth of the business. They  remain at the heart of everything   we do. Evolution of the strategy and   further financial delivery leading   to enhanced shareholder returns I am delighted to present another strong  set of results. We have continued to deliver on our  progressive dividend policy this year,  increasing our dividend by 18.1% to 8.5p.  This equates to a payout ratio of 62% 1  of  net earnings, compared to 57% 2  in the  previous year. Last year, we increased  our target payout range from 40%-60%,  to 50%-70% as a sign of our confidence  that we will continue to deliver strong  financial performance. This year’s  decision to increase the dividend   again reflects the Board’s ongoing  confidence in the sustainability of our  dividend policy, which is supported by   a strong track record of profit growth  and cash generation through our   capital efficient model. Financially, we have again delivered  growth in underlying profit before tax   of 5.6% to £187.4m and basic earnings  per share by 6.0% to 14.1p. Furthermore,  we have continued to be highly cash  generative, resulting in a further  deleveraging such that our net debt to  EBITDA ratio has reduced to 1.9 times.
