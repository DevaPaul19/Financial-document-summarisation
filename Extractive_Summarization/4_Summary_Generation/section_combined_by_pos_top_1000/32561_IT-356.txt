In order to provide   a clearer comparison throughout  this report, year-on-year growth   in numbers relating to revenue,  underlying profit and underlying  earnings per share are shown  using a 52-week comparative,  which excludes the final week  of the 2015/16 financial year.  All other statutory comparatives  and numbers shown at the balance  sheet date reflect the financial  statements and do not exclude  the 53rd week of the prior year. Performance measures   The performance of the Group   is monitored internally using   a variety of statutory measures  such as total revenue and profit  before tax and alternative  performance measures (APMs)  such as underlying profit before   tax, like for like sales and return   on capital. APMs are not defined  within IFRS and are used to   assess the underlying operational  performance of the Group.   As such these measures should   be considered alongside  IFRS measures. â€    Definitions of all APMs are  included in the glossary on  page 175. 2016/17  highlights Total basic EPS was 231.39p (2015/16 215.66p) Overview Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 04 Strategic report Chairmanâ€™s statement Although the modern day  Whitbread is very different from  the original brewing business  founded by Samuel Whitbread in  1742, we are immensely proud of  our history and it is a great honour  for me and my colleagues on the  Board to play our own part in the  Whitbread story.  The links to our heritage remain strong.  Our base is still in Bedfordshire and   we are delighted to be able to welcome  members of the Whitbread family to   our Annual General Meeting each year,  whilst our core values of investing in   our Winning Teams and being a Force  for Good in our communities remain as  important to us today as they always  have been. We are very aware of our responsibility  to ensure that this great British company  continues to thrive and, as such, we are  focused both on driving growth and  managing risk to an appropriate level,  whilst exhibiting excellent corporate  governance. We operate a conservative  approach to the management of our  balance sheet and this provides us   with a solid base in turbulent and  changing times. Our Winning Teams are the key to our  success and I would like to thank our  50,000 employees for the fantastic  work they do in giving our customers   a great experience.  Consistent strategy I explained this time last year that the  fundamentals of our strategy, which   is to provide sustainable long-term  value for our shareholders by growing  our successful Premier Inn and Costa  brands, whilst delivering a good   return on capital, were unchanged.   This remains true today, as we continue  undaunted by political upheaval and  economic uncertainty. We have a clear plan and we have   made good progress against the three  strategic priorities outlined by our   Chief Executive, Alison Brittain, last  April. These are to grow and innovate in  our core UK businesses; to focus on our  strengths to grow internationally; and   to build the capability and platform to  support future growth. More detail on  our strategy can be found on pages   10 to 13 and information on progress  against our strategic objectives can   be found on pages 41 to 45. We have remained on course to deliver  our objectives, whilst at the same time,  refreshing our Board and the executive  leadership team. I believe that the new  team will enable Whitbread to enter   the next phase of its life with renewed  vigour and confidence. Richard Baker  Chairman We have a clear plan   and we have made   good progress against   our strategic priorities Whitbread, one of Britainâ€™s oldest and   most successful companies, celebrates   275 years in business this year.  275 This year is our 275th  anniversary Â£8.9m Raised since 2012 to fund the  Premier Inn Clinical Building at  Great Ormond Street Hospital 11 Costa Foundation school  projects completed in 2016/17 +6.0% Increase in full year dividend Force   for Good Strategic report Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 05 The third new appointment to the Board  this year is that of Adam Crozier, with  effect from 1 April 2017.
