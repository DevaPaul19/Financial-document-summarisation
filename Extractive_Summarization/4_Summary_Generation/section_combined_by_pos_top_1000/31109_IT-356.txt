Animalcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 www.animalcaregroup.co.uk Stock Code: ANCR STRATEGIC REPORT  OUR BUSINESS 01 26011   18/05/2018   Proof 4 CHAIRMAN’S   STATEMENT 2017 was a transformational year for Animalcare  Group plc. Whilst characterised by continued  organic growth, the most dominant factor during  the year was the reverse acquisition of Ecuphar  NV (“Ecuphar”). The transaction completed  on 13 th  July 2017 and our statutory results for  the year ended December 2017 reflect a full  12 months contribution from Ecuphar and five  and a half months of Animalcare Group plc  (“Animalcare”), as previously constituted. 2016  comparatives are only for the Ecuphar business.  Financial Trading Group revenue increased by 22.4% to £83.7m  (2016: £68.4m) with 11.3% organic growth  within the Ecuphar business which contributed  £76.1m to overall Group revenues and  £7.6m from the original Animalcare business.  Underlying EBITDA (which excludes fair value  adjustments on acquired inventory, amortisation  of acquired intangibles and acquisition and  integration costs) increased by 11.9% to £10.0m  (2016: £8.9m) with £1.6m contributed by the  Animalcare business. This performance primarily  reflects the impact of lower gross margins,  investments to support future growth and the  disposal of Nutriscience which Ecuphar sold in  October 2016. Including non-underlying items,  the Group’s profit before tax decreased to £0.5m  (2016: £5.1m). The Group generated £2.6m  (2016: £9.3m) net cash from operations which  included a cash outflow from non-underlying  items totalling £3.8m.  Further details on business performance  can be found in the CEO Review and CFO  Review respectively. Board Following the acquisition, the executive Directors  comprised Chris Cardon, who took on the role of  Chief Executive Officer for the enlarged group,  supported by Iain Menneer as Chief Operating  Officer and Walter Beyers as Chief Financial  Officer. In September 2017 Chris Brewster, who  at the time of the acquisition stood down as a  Board Director but remained within the business,  was reappointed to the Board as Chief Financial  Officer, replacing Walter Beyers who resigned   to pursue other interests. More recently Iain  Menneer stood down as Chief Operating Officer.  I would like to take the opportunity to recognise  both Iain’s and Walter’s contributions and we  wish them well for the future.  Dividend The Board is proposing a final dividend of 2.0  pence per share, which when added to the  second interim dividend of 4.7 pence per shares  gives a total dividend of 6.7 pence per share  since the reverse acquisition. This final dividend  is subject to shareholder approval at the   Annual General Meeting on 27th June 2018   and will be paid on 6th July 2018 to shareholders  on the register at the close of business on   8th June 2018. Product Development A key strategy for growth remains the continued  cultivation of a strong new product development  pipeline. In 2017 we launched Acecare, a  sedative, from Animalcare’s original UK pipeline  and sales have performed in line with internal  forecasts. We have deliberately focused the  development team on 17 active projects and we  have a steady flow of products that are going  through registration and are expected to launch  in 2018 and 2019.  Summary and Outlook Having brought together two highly  complementary businesses, in particular with  regard to our respective geographic markets,  product portfolios and product development  pipelines, we are growing a successful pan- European animal health business. We have the  opportunity to continue this growth through  further strategic acquisitions, but also through  organic growth focused on existing products  and our product development pipeline, as well  as the synergies and benefits of cross-selling  which we expect to see impacting our Q4 2018  performance and more meaningfully in 2019.  We believe we have created a platform for strong  future growth and I look forward to updating on  our progress.
