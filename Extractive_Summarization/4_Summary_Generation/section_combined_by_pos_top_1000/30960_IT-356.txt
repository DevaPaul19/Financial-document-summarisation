About us GMS assets provide a stable platform for   the delivery of a wide range of services  performed by the Group’s national and  international oil company clients and  engineering, procurement and construction  contractors throughout the life cycle of  offshore oil and gas projects and operators  in the renewable energy (wind farm-related)  industry. Our vessels are capable of  operations in water depths of up to 80m   that are typically found in the Middle East,  South East Asia, West Africa and Europe.  We pride ourselves on being at the forefront  of technological innovation and construct  and maintain our own vessels at our  quayside yard in Abu Dhabi. Our extensive  new build programme in recent years has  made the GMS fleet one of the most  sophisticated in the industry.  A modern fleet fit for the future  The Group’s core fleet of 13 SESVs is amongst  the youngest in the industry, with an average  age of just seven years, and this makes it  highly attractive to clients seeking to charter  the most advanced and cost-efficient vessels  for their current and longer-term operations.  Our SESVs are four-legged vessels that   move independently, with no requirement   for anchor handling or tug support. They   have a large deck space, crane capacity and  accommodation facilities that can be adapted  to the requirements of our clients. These  vessels support our clients in a broad range   of offshore oil and gas platform refurbishment  and maintenance activities, well intervention  work and offshore wind turbine maintenance  work (which are opex-led activities), as well   as offshore oil and gas platform installation and  decommissioning and offshore wind turbine  installation (which are capex-led activities).
