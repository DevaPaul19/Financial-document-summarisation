ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 12 OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW PENSIONS  Our pensions businesses have all seen significant changes to their  modus operandi following the UK Spring Budget.  Total revenue across our pensions businesses amounted to £10.2  million (2016: £9.2 million) and accounted for 47% of total Group  revenue (2016: 52%).  As predicted since the UK Spring Budget, our Gibraltar operation  has seen almost no new business with regards to ROPS, whilst  Malta is now only receiving new business from the EEA.  Conversely, our UK SIPP business has become the focus of new  business growth. To put this in context, for the nine months following the Budget,  new business numbers were 217 ROPS (2016: 1,224) administered  by our Malta and Gibraltar offices and 755 SIPPs (2016: 162)  administered from our UK operations. Malta remains the largest of our three jurisdictions with pension  turnover of £6.1 million (2016: £6.5 million), with Gibraltar  generating £2.6 million (2016: £2.4 million) of turnover, and finally,  in its first full year under STM’s ownership, the UK generated  £1.5 million of revenue (2016: £0.3 million).  An important KPI remains the annual recurring revenue statistic  which has been determined as the contractual element of any  trustee fee due or any fees under the life assurance policies, which  are billed on an annual basis. For 2017 this amounted to £9.6  million (2016: £8.5 million) which represents 95% (2016: 93%)  of total pension revenue, giving a highly visible and predictable  future revenue stream.  LIFE ASSURANCE The acquisition of London & Colonial in late 2016, and with it  the Gibraltar based life assurance company (LCA), has allowed  STM to significantly grow its life assurance business. This is seen from the 2017 combined revenue figure of £5.9  million as compared to £2.8 million for 2016. Pleasingly, organic growth for STM Life during the year has  delivered a 26% uplift, to generate turnover for 2017 of £2.4  million (2016: £1.9 million). Within this revenue figure, recurring  revenue, annual fees and investment income amounted to £1.8  million compared to £1.4 million in 2016. This provides a steady  and highly visible annuity income stream. In addition, LCA has performed as expected with its long standing  and predictable customer base delivering a revenue of £2.2 million  for the year, with a further release from technical reserves of  £1.3 million (2016: £0.5 million) as a result of the reduction in  the administrative costs per policy.  CORPORATE AND TRUSTEE SERVICES Turnover from the Corporate and Trustee Services (CTS) division  for the year was £4.3 million (2016: £4.4 million) thus accounting  for 20% of the Group’s total turnover (2016: 25%). This business is  generated in Jersey and Gibraltar, with Jersey revenue accounting  for circa 57% (2016: 56%) of the CTS business at £2.5 million  (2016: £2.5 million) and Gibraltar generating turnover of £1.8  million (2016: £1.9 million). As noted in previous years’ reports, the CTS environment and  sector remains challenging, and it is accepted by the Group that  this will be a difficult segment to grow organically.  OTHER TRADING DIVISIONS AND NEW  INITIATIVES Trading in other divisions, which are mainly insurance management  and the Spanish office, was broadly in line with management  expectations. These are expected to continue at similar levels  going forward having generated revenue of £1.2 million in the  year (2016: £1.1 million).  FINANCIAL REVIEW PERFORMANCE IN THE YEAR Profitability has seen a step change in 2017, compared to that of  2016, but reflects the hard work of building the infrastructure  and business development function in previous years.  Clearly, the integration of the LCH acquisition has enabled us  to restructure the cost base of those businesses acquired and  ensured that profit margins were enhanced. Group revenue for 2017 amounted to £21.5 million (2016: £17.4  million), and as anticipated EBITDA (Earnings before interest,  taxation, depreciation and amortisation) has increased by 55%  from £3.1 million in 2016 to £4.8 million in 2017.  Reassuringly, the amount of recurring annuity revenue business  continues to increase and still accounts for 75% of 2017 total  revenues (2016: 75%).  Finance costs amounted to £0.3 million (2016: £0.1 million) and  reflects the debt financing in place for the LCH acquisition. The  depreciation and amortisation charge has in turn increased as a  result of amortising the client portfolio acquired with LCH and  the investment in offices across various jurisdictions. This is £0.5  million in 2017 (2016: £0.3 million).  Profit before tax was
