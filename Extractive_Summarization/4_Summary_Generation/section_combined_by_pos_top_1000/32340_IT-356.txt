We play a vital role in connecting millions of  people to the energy they use, safely, reliably and efficiently. We  are organised into operating segments, which we describe below. UK Electricity Transmission We own and operate the electricity  transmission network in England and Wales,  with day-to-day responsibility for balancing  supply and demand. We operate but do not  own the Scottish networks. Our networks  comprise approximately 7 ,200 kilometres   (4,474 miles) of overhead line, 1,500 kilometres  (932 miles) of underground cable and 342  substations. UK Gas Transmission We own and operate the gas National  Transmission System (NTS) in Great Britain,  with day-to-day responsibility for balancing  supply and demand. Our network comprises  approximately 7 ,660 kilometres (4,760 miles)   of high-pressure pipe and 618 above-ground  installations. Our role as system operator As Great Britain’s System Operator (SO) we make sure Great Britain’s gas and electricity is  transported safely and efficiently from where it is produced to where it is consumed. We seek to  ensure that supply and demand are balanced in real-time and we facilitate the connection of assets  to the transmission system. In the US, similar services are provided by independent system operators.
