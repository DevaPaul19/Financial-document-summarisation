Cambian’s   Chairman� s statement Overview Following the sale of our Adult Services  business to Cygnet Health Care Limited  (Cygnet), a wholly owned subsidiary of the  US company Universal Health Services, Inc.  at the end of 2016, Cambian became a pure  children’s specialist education and behavioural  health services business, offering a full range  of essential services from therapeutic fostering  through to specialist schools and residential  care. As at the end of 2017, we managed  222 facilities and employed over 4,500 staff,  looking after 1,920 children and young people. 2017 has been a year of transition as we  established our platform to achieve modest  growth and become the leading provider in  children’s services. As part of the conditions  of the sale of our Adult Services business to  Cygnet, we undertook to support these activities  through a transitional services agreement  (TSA) on commercial terms with Cygnet, which  required significant management and staff  resources until the TSA completed at the end of  June. We were not therefore able to right size  all our cost base until the second half of last  year. However, since then we have undertaken  a significant cost-cutting exercise. This will result  in approximately £8.5 million of cost reductions  on an annualised basis, half of which have  been reflected in 2017. We have also spent 2017 repositioning the  business towards a differentiated integrated  recovery model incorporating care, education  and therapy for children with the highest needs,  which is where we believe there is a significant  shortage of care and education facilities.  This transformation has led us to review all  of our facilities and where appropriate we  have closed certain facilities that cannot be  re-positioned cost-effectively . We have largely  completed this process with one facility likely to  be closed or sold in 2018. This transformation  has also led us to review the strength of our  management team and its ability to deliver  more acute services, as a result of which  we have made a number of senior hires,  comprising Head of Special Educational Needs,  Head of Fostering, Director of Quality and  Director of People. We are confident that we  now have the right senior management team  to successfully manage and grow the business. Our focus during the year has been to fill  existing capacity, increase fee levels from  higher acuity services and reduce the cost  base to increase margins. Good progress has  been made on increasing average fee levels  and average occupancy levels have been  maintained whilst re-positioning services.
