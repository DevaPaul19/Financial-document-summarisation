The Group’s  statutory profit before tax increased by 13%  to £112.4m (2016: £99.8m). Overview Savills delivered a further strong performance  in 2017 . In addition to substantial commercial  transaction volumes in both the UK and a  number of Asian and European markets,  the relative resilience of Savills UK  Residential transaction business, which  achieved year-on-year revenue growth in  challenging markets, was of particular note.  This again demonstrated the importance of  Savills strengths in prime markets of many  of the world’s key cities where we increased  market share. Currency movements also  had a positive effect on the Group  contributing approximately £3.9m in  underlying profit and £2.8m in statutory  profit before tax on translation. Our Transaction Advisory revenue grew by  13%, our Consultancy business revenue by  14% and our Property Management revenue  by 9%, including the full year effect of the  2016 UK acquisition of GBR Phoenix Beard.  Against the uncertain backdrop of world  markets, Savills Commercial Transaction  business grew revenue by 15% with strong  performances in many markets including the  UK and significant growth in the Asia Pacific  region, in particular, Hong Kong, China,  Japan and Australia. Our Residential  businesses withstood challenging conditions  achieving revenue growth of over 6%. Finally,  Savills Investment Management Assets under  Management (‘AUM’) increased to £14.6bn  (2016: £13.9bn). Investment Management  revenue declined as anticipated, reflecting the  reduced level of disposal transactions from  the liquidating SEB German Open Ended  Funds we inherited as part of the acquisition  of SEB Asset Management in 2015. The reduction in transaction fees in the  Investment Management business, together  with a decline in the volume of larger  complex transactions in the US and the  costs of expansion in a number of markets  restricted the underlying profit margin to  8.8% (2016: 9.4%). The statutory pre-tax  profit margin remained stable at 7.0% (2016:  6.9%), with lower acquisition-related costs  and profits on disposal of investments  offsetting the aforementioned expansion  costs and decline in the US business. …during a history of financial crisis Total   dividend Underlying  profit Statutory profit  before tax 1875 1900 1925 1950 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 1987  Black Monday 1997  The Asian Crisis 2000  Acquired FPD  Savills (Asia) 1997  First link with Asia 1988  Savills listed   on the London  Stock Exchange 30.2p £140.5m £112.4m (2016: 29.0p) (2016: £135.8m) (2016: £99.8m) Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview 05 Savills plc  Report and Accounts 2017 Business development Savills strategy is to be a leading advisor in  the key markets in which we operate.
