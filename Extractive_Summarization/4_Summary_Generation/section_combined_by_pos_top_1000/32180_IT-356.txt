Telford Homes is skilled in all aspects of  London development and we can apply our  knowledge and expertise to a wider range   of opportunities in new boroughs.  We develop in non-prime locations to  maintain an affordable price point for our  individual customers and our strategic move  into build to rent provides scope to work  with investment partners across London.

Our ability  to deliver forward sold homes to our customers  on programme, together with a step change in our  presence in the build to rent sector, saw Telford  Homes achieving excellent results for the year to  31 March 2017.  I am particularly pleased that we  achieved a 99 per cent customer recommendation  rate in 2016, a notable endorsement of our  commitment to quality and service.  Since February 2016 we have exchanged contracts  on four significant build to rent transactions with  a range of investors, indicative of our growing  reputation in the sector as a trusted delivery partner.   Along with monitoring external influences on the  Group, the development of our build to rent strategy  has been one of the principal areas of focus for  the Board this year.  This sector complements our  historic focus on individual sales to investors and  owner-occupiers and is well aligned with our forward  selling philosophy.  The attractive return on capital  and lower risk profile associated with build to rent  'We are well positioned to continue the growth of Telford  Homes thanks to the strength of our performance in the  undersupplied non-prime London housing market and   our increasing activity in the build to rent sector.'  Andrew Wiseman Chairman CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT DEVELOPING IN LONDON:  A STRONG PERFORMANCE will facilitate accelerated growth for Telford Homes,  although the Board remains mindful of ensuring   the business grows in a controlled manner in order  that our high standards of operational performance  are upheld. Dividend The Board is pleased to declare a final dividend  of 8.5 pence per share, making a total of 15.7  pence per share for the year, an increase of just  over 10 per cent compared with the previous  year (2016: 14.2 pence).  Our policy is to pay one  third of earnings as dividends in each financial  year.  For the year to 31 March 2017 however,  the Board has fulfilled its promise to increase the  dividend payment above that level in order to offset  the dilution in earnings resulting from the equity  placing in late 2015.  Therefore, the interim dividend  together with the full year dividend equates to  over 40 per cent of earnings for this financial year.   The final dividend will be paid on 14 July 2017 to  those shareholders on the register at the close of  business on 16 June 2017.  The ex-dividend date is  therefore 15 June 2017. Culture and values I have always been proud of the single team culture  and strong values of Telford Homes.  In the last year  we have recruited talented people from outside  of the business at levels not seen previously.  As  Telford Homes continues to grow and our strategy  evolves, there is a need to ensure that the culture  that has made the business so successful to date is  preserved, yet able to adapt to the requirements of a  larger organisation.  For this reason, the Group plans  to review its corporate vision, mission and values  during 2017 to ensure these reflect the evolving  position of the business and allow us to capitalise   on the opportunities that lie ahead. 06 In a year that has seen strong operational growth, our  admirable health and safety record merits mention.   Health and safety is the first item on the agenda
