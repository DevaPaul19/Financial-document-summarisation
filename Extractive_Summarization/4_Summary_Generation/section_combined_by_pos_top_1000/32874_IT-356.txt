Macro-economic factors and strategy  In 2017 energy prices were significantly  less volatile than in 2016, when they   hit ten-year lows, with Brent crude oil  rising through a range of USD 47-67/ bbl1. The recovery in oil prices has been  driven by OPEC and non-OPEC countries,  mainly Russia, first agreeing to and then  extending their production cuts at the   end of 20171, which also supported   a strong year-end finish in the oil price.  In addition to production cuts, IOCs  continue to invest selectively with typical  projects being sanctioned on the basis of  an oil price of USD 60/bbl2 or less which  further supports energy prices. However ,  North American shale capacity and the  ability to ramp up production quickly acts  as a natural brake to significant price  increases and this dynamic between  shale and OPEC’s self-imposed cuts is  expected to continue throughout 2018.  Within the Middle East, NOC investment  is driven more by considerations related  to market share and funding government  budgets, and investment in the region is  expected to continue or even grow from  recent years 3,4 .   While the traditional oil industry faces  some uncertainty, the renewables industry  continues to develop rapidly and attract  investment, especially in the offshore  wind environment which is Lamprell’s  area of focus in this growing market.  The known global portfolio of offshore  wind has the potential to deliver 92GW,  with circa 75GW still to be awarded and  built. Europe leads the way globally, with  the UK and Germany by far the largest  participants to date in this market5.   The offshore wind industry is undergoing  a fundamental shift from an industry that  needs subsidies to attract investment,  to one that is commercial and attracts  investment in its own right. The 2017 UK  Contract for Difference (CfD) Round 2  auction delivered a strike price of   £57.50/MWh for two wind farms, some  50% below that achieved two years  earlier6,
