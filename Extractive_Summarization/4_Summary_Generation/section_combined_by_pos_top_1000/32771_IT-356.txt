The stable long-term income from anchor tenants underpins the ability to generate higher revenues from the more flexible  leasing options. We have created a range of innovative and flexible products by investing into sub-optimal space. This attracts a large number  of tenants to our sites whilst generating higher income and asset value growth from space that would often be left vacant or  rented at low prices.
