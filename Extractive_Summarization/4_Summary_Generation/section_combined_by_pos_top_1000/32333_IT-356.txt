Dividend  Given the Group’s performance this year  and the Board’s confidence in its future  prospects, the Board is proposing an increase  in the final dividend to 11.2p a share, bringing  the total ordinary dividend for the year to  15.3p (FY16: 12.7p), an increase of 24%, which  is 1.76x covered by the FY17 adjusted earnings  per share compared to 1.72x in FY16.  Board changes During the year David Bower was appointed  as Chief Financial Officer and Johnathan  Ford as Chief Operating Officer. We have  also strengthened the Board with the  appointment of three new Directors with  effect from 23 May 2017. Tom Rusin has  been appointed as an Executive Director  and Katrina Cliffe and Edward Fitzmaurice  have both been appointed as Non-Executive  Directors.

People  HomeServe’s success is driven by the  commitment of its people. On behalf of the  Board, I would like to thank all our people for  their contribution to another set of very good  results. JM Barry Gibson Chairman  23 May 2017 Chairman’s statement I am delighted that the Group had  another very good year delivering  customer and profit growth, with  continued investment to deliver our  strategy. We have a clear vision “to  be the world’s most trusted provider  of home repairs and improvements”  and we have agreed the strategic  priorities (see page 12 for our  strategic framework) to ensure we  achieve it.  There are four areas of progress in the  year that I would like to specifically  address in this statement.  Firstly, the rate of progress in North  America has been very positive. Through  the strength of the existing business,  enhanced with the acquisition of Utility  Service Partners we have achieved the  3m customer milestone and 50m affinity  partner households – great progress  toward our 80m household target.  Secondly, the strength of affinity  partnerships is the bedrock of our  business and I am delighted with the  launch of Aviva Response in the UK and  the new joint venture with Edison Energia  in Italy. Digital marketing is already live  with both partners, a demonstration of  our mutual commitment. At the Capital Markets Day in June  last year, we said we wanted to offer  a compelling on demand service to  homeowners. We have accelerated   our plans with the investment in  Checkatrade in the UK and the   acquisition of Habitissimo in Spain.  Overview 5 Annual Report & Accounts 2017 JM Barry Gibson “I am pleased to welcome USP, Checkatrade   and Habitissimo to the HomeServe family and  look forward to making the most of our   on demand opportunity.” 6 Strategic report by 93 of customers would  buy again. % Based on 1,970 real reviews, from customers like you.

Affinity partner  households increased by 10m to  102m, with a significant increase in  North America. This is in addition  to 11% Group customer growth,  with customer numbers now at  7.8m. Statutory operating profit was  up 20% to £104.7m, and adjusted  operating profit increased 22% to  £118.8m, both included a £10.3m  foreign exchange benefit.   A solid performance in the UK delivered  over half of the Group’s operating profit,  while we also continued to invest in new  partnerships, network capability, LeakBot  and heating services.  The business in North America had  a transformational year, completing  the acquisition and integration of  Utility Service Partners Inc. (USP)  while continuing to sign new partners  organically. As a result, we made rapid  progress towards the targeted 80m  affinity partner households, where 18m  households were added during FY17,  taking total access to 50m households.  Organic customer
