A1  Chairman’ s stat ement  The year in summary PAGE 10 A3 Chief Executive’s review   The financial and oper ational perf ormance o f the Gr oup in the year PAGE 21 During the year, the asset finance business acquired in 2015 and the development finance business  launched organically continued to develop, while the Mortgages division launched its first pilot offerings in the  specialist owner-occupied mortgage market. The new financial year will see the first loans in structured lending and aviation finance, as the Group’s  diversification continues. Significant cost investment has been made in developing these newer business lines during 2017 and further  investments are anticipated in the coming year. The Group’s business is described more fully in section A2 Results The growth in the Group’s loan books, up 3.6% to £11,124.1 million, contributed to an increase in underlying  profit by 1.0% to £145.2 million after absorbing £10.9 million of interest cost in respect of the Group’s  £150.0 million Tier 2 Bond (2016: £143.8 million). Profit before tax on the statutory basis grew by 1.1% to  £144.8 million. This led to earnings per share increasing by 6.4% to 43.1 pence (2016: 40.5 pence) and return  on tangible equity reaching 13.4% (2016: 12.9%). Funding was enhanced with the growth of the Group’s savings deposit base to £3,615.4 million from  £1,873.9 million a year earlier and the utilisation of the Bank of England’s Term Funding Scheme (‘TFS’), where  drawings had reached £700.0 million by the year end. The Group’s capital position remains strong, with regulatory Core Equity Tier 1 (‘CET1’) capital of £876.1 million  (2016: £838.6 million). The CET1 ratio at 30 September 2017 remained stable at 15.9% (2016: 15.9%). The financial results and operational performance are reviewed in section A3 Robert G Dench
