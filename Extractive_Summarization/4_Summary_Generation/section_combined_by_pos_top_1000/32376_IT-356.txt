The evolution from  an industrial tape company to a global  adhesive technology-based company with  two distinct businesses, each with an exciting  strategy and outlook, has been impressive.  During the past eight years, Scapa’s share  price has risen from £0.095 in March 2009 to  £4.00 in May 2017 , generating over £600m of  shareholder value. As I review the results and  accomplishments of the Group, I am very  impressed with the volume and pace of the  activities. However, I am equally impressed  with the vision and opportunities that still  remain to fully achieve Scapa’s potential  in both Healthcare and Industrial.  GREAT PROGRESS AND POTENTIAL The Healthcare business has been  transformed from a roll stock material  supplier to market leader in turn-key solutions  of adhesive based products. At an early  stage we recognised the increasing trend  towards outsourcing in our customers and  positioned ourselves as the partner of choice  to the leading global healthcare companies.  Driven by pricing pressure and the need to  accelerate time to market, our customers are  looking for partners who not only provide  materials and manufacturing but can provide  turn-key solutions across their entire value  chain, from product development to delivery
