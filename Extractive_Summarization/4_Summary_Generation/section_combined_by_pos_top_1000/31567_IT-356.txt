I am pleased to report that the year-end audit and  subsequent review of revenue recognition did not  show up any additional material problems around  accounting irregularities, nor did it increase the size  of the related adjustment materially.  Our finance team are to be congratulated for  their diligence and integrity in standing up for the  correct treatment and precise year end cut off. On  the downside, we have expended considerable  management time on resolving these issues. There have been more robust discussions and  technical analysis of revenue recognition accounting  policies, in particular around the complex area of  6PM software licence treatment. As a result, an  adjustment was made to management figures  relating to 6PM licence revenue. The Board Richard Kellett-Clarke, who had become a Non- Executive Director of Idox in November 2016 after a  successful tenure as our Chief Executive, stepped  back in as Interim Chief Executive in December  2017 following the regrettable illness of his original  successor Andrew Riley. Andrew remains on  extended sick leave. I am pleased to report that  Richard has been able to rapidly execute on a  plan to get the business back on track as soon as  possible and will help out for as long as necessary.  2017 proved to be a year of change and  contrasting performance for Idox; after a promising  start to the year, it is disappointing to report on a  mixed set of results for the year as a whole.  The early part of the year was focused on  completion of the acquisition of 6PM, a software  and solutions business whose main customer  is the UK NHS, which represented a significant  expansion in the health and social care market.   We made a further important acquisition in August,  of Halarose, an electoral back office software and  services business that has significantly enhanced  our elections’ capabilities.  “ Spanning both the public and private sectors,  Idox works across a range of industries and  sectors – from central and local government to  transport, health and social care and commercial  organisations, to deliver smart technology that  enhances services and improves productivity.”   Laurence Vaughan Chairman 04 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 Peter Lilley, who joined the Board in 2005 will step down from his  role at
