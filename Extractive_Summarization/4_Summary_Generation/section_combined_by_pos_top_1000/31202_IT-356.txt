About  12p of this increase was due to the one‑off revaluation of US  deferred tax liabilities as a result of the recently enacted US tax  reforms. As previously announced, these changes are expected  to reduce the group’s future effective tax rate from a percentage  number in the mid-thirties to a number in the high-twenties,  resulting in an ongoing earnings per share enhancement of  between 5p and 10p per share each year. As a result, and reflecting confidence in the group’s prospects,  the Board has decided to rebase future dividends and accordingly  recommends a 20% increase in the 2017 full year dividend to  34.2p (2016: 28.5p). Full year 2017 dividend cover, before  non‑underlying items, is 3.0x (2016: 2.7x). This recommendation results in a proposed 2017 final dividend  of 24.5p per share (2016: 19.25p per share), a 27% increase, to be  paid on 22 June 2018 to shareholders on the register as at the  close of business on 1 June 2018.  The group intends to maintain a progressive dividend policy  in the future. Outlook Our group order book of over £1bn gives us confidence as we  start 2018. Most of our markets remain robust, bidding activity  is at a healthy level and Keller is well positioned to address the  market trends of urbanisation and infrastructure growth. Two  significant loss‑making contracts in APAC in 2017 masked some  good progress in the region and we continue to expect the  division to return to profit in 2018. Overall, despite the completion  of our excellent Caspian project, we expect 2018 to be another  year of underlying progress, albeit with recent currency  movements expected to result in translational headwinds  on reported profits. We are now seeing tangible results from a number of the  strategic initiatives launched in the last two years. We are  confident that a combination of these improvement initiatives,  our technical leadership, wide product portfolio, broad branch  network and operational strength will continue to drive our  business forward.  Peter Hill CBE Chairman 26 February 2018 Board  As previously announced, Dr Venu Raju, who was appointed  Engineering and Operations Director (Designate) at the  beginning of 2016 was appointed an Executive Director from  1 January 2017.

Paul Withers was appointed  Chairman of the Remuneration Committee with effect from  Ruth’s retirement.  Eva Lindqvist joined the Board on 1 June 2017 as an independent  Non-executive Director after an external search. Eva is a  Non-executive Director, and Chairman of the Remuneration  Committee at Bodycote plc.  Road Traffic Accident We were devastated after a serious road accident in July  of 2017, near Machadodorp, South Africa, left 18 of our  Franki Africa employees dead and a number seriously injured.  We provided care and support to those directly impacted and  trauma counselling was made available for the families of the  deceased and injured as well as for colleagues. Practical and  financial arrangements were also made to assist families to  travel from their homes around South Africa to the various  hospitals where the deceased and injured had been taken.  We also advanced financial support for funeral costs and other  expenses and provided assistance to families and victims to  claim benefits from pension and insurance providers.  Memorial services were arranged and held in Machadodorp  (jointly with our client, the Nkomati Mine), and at Franki Africa  branches in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban. The hundreds of messages received from all over the world via  a Keller-wide online condolence board have formed a memorial  book. An online portal was also established for colleagues to  make voluntary financial contributions to the victims’ families  if they wished. In recognition of those employees involved in the accident,  Keller
