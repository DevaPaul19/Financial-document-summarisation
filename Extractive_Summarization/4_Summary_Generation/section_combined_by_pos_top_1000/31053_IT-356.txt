Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report Strategic Report / Chairman’s Statement SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 05 EARLIER OPTIMISM JUSTIFIED  In my report for 2016, I advised that, given the  strength of our then current order book and  short-term pipeline, we anticipated that the  growth we were seeing would continue into  at least the first half of 2017. We also noted  that, in keeping with the pattern over previous  years, we anticipated that our second half- year financial performance in 2017 would be  substantially stronger than the first half. This was, indeed, the case and I am pleased  to report that our optimism and guidance was  well placed. The Group delivered a strong  overall performance in 2017, with results for  full-year revenues and adjusted profits being  comfortably in line with guidance. It is also  pleasing to report a positive advance on net  margins, which is in line with our strategic  objectives. Going into 2018 the outlook continues to be  very encouraging. The positive news flow across the year on  new business wins was crowned by the  announcement in late October of the award  of a €18m contract with OHB System AG  to deliver the ground station control and  communications infrastructure for Heinrich  Hertz, the German national satellite- communications mission. Further contract  wins across the Group in the last quarter of  2017 also meant that we entered 2018 with a  record order book of £91.3m. Operational cash flows were very healthy  across the year, resulting in further reductions  in net debt and underpinning a healthy 10%  uplift in the recommended final dividend  payment. With the acquisition of the ANNOVA  Systems GmbH (“Annova”) business our  income streams (which are predominantly in  £ sterling and €) are well balanced, providing  an internal hedge against exchange-rate  movements. We do not anticipate any major  impact on profitability in 2018 from currency  fluctuations or hedging adjustments. Further detail on the performance of each  division is given below. However, it is worth  noting the overall healthy organic growth and  impressive contract wins that contributed to  our strong operating cash flows. Our Space  division in particular deserves a specific  mention for its extraordinary achievement,  with 18% year-on-year growth in revenues  and a 17% growth in contribution. Of strategic note is the performance of our  Annova division. A primary focus going into  2017 was the integration of Annova into the  Group. We have started a programme to align  Annova’s internal processes with SCISYS’  high standards. Solid, on-going progress can  be reported here. Its performance is closely  aligned with the Group’s expectations at the  time of acquisition. Delivery of a key milestone  on Annova’s BBC newsroom contract was  achieved in late summer, with the system now  on air in the West Midlands and in Salford.  Significant contract wins with MDR, ARD’s  national news programme in Germany and  Corus in Canada have strengthened its  geographic footprint. Synergies with our Media  & Broadcast (M&B) division resulted in a major  new win for M&B with RTL in France, where  our dira! system is already on air.  In addition to winning the Heinrich Hertz  project, our Space division has extended  its footprint in the Galileo project while our  Enterprise Solutions and Defence (ESD)  division has seen key wins late in the year  with Public Health England, and the Forestry  Commission, as well as new work with a  major defence prime contractor. The strength of the order book within both  our Space and ESD divisions is resulting in a  significant expansion of their teams – with an  associated recruitment drive. Similar growth  has resulted in the Group opening a new  office in Dortmund to house our M&B division.  Strategically we
