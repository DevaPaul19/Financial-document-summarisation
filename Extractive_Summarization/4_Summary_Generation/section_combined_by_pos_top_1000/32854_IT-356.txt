As we began the year, the integration of  Baxalta was well under way. A company  that had commercial operating units in 22  countries in 2013 is now in more than 60  countries. A clinical pipeline with 20  programs in 2013, ended 2017 with 40  such active programs. And our therapeutic  footprint had expanded into three new  dynamic areas: immunology, hematology,  and oncology. Shire has transformed itself, but with this  transformation came obvious challenges.  We had a global manufacturing portfolio  that required careful pruning and  disciplined, efficient management.  In many countries we had to consolidate  two offices into one, moving and  reassigning experienced staff, while  maintaining commercial momentum.  And we set aggressive targets for our  teams, pushing ourselves to meet the  highest possible financial goals, some  of which were clearly aspirational. At the end of 2017, the people of  Shire could look back with pride.  The implementation of our Network  Manufacturing Study laid the foundation  for efficient and effective supply operations.  And at the same time, Shire exceeded its  challenging integration synergy targets for  the year, saving money and managing its  global procurement systems in the most  cost-effective and efficient manner. Despite these many achievements,  Shire’s share price performance was  disappointing. For a Board, management  team, and company focused on improving  shareholder value, the challenge is clear  and we have strengthened our resolve to  improve and succeed in 2018. For Shire, success means delivering more  innovative solutions to the patients who  depend on us. We know that if patients,  physicians, and caregivers appreciate and  value our products, then shareholders will  also benefit. In this way 2017 was not just  a year of integration, but also one of  preparation for the future. In 2017, we launched 50 products in  25  countries with therapies to treat  diseases such as short bowel syndrome,  hypoparathyroidism and attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We  significantly advanced our Research and  Development (R&D) pipeline with 54  major market filings around the world  and continued to invest in areas where  we see great need and opportunity such  as immunology. We maintained our dedication to our  environment and the communities in which  we serve. In 2017, Shire developed our new  Responsibility strategy with commitments  and long-term goals to be achieved by  2025. We also held our third annual Global  Day of Service, during which more than  7,300 Shire employees from around the  world dedicated more than 29,000 hours  of their time to volunteering in their  communities. A detailed description  of Shire’s commitment to Responsibility  can be found on page 35. The accomplishments — focused squarely  on delivering benefits to patients in need  and the communities in
