Group revenue  is up 15% (9% at constant currencies) and  profit before taxation and highlighted  items after incurring the development  costs for new digital content products  is £12.0 million (2016: £13.0 million),  above market expectations. The Board  is recommending a final dividend of 5.6  pence per share to shareholders on the  register on 25 August 2017. This represents an increase in full year  dividend of 5% and continues Bloomsbury’s dividend growth each  year for over 20 years. The past year was Bloomsbury’s 30th and the 23rd year of listing on  the London Stock Exchange. Looking back to the time of the 1994  listing, the proposition was to be a medium–sized independent  publisher of works of the highest literary and commercial  quality. Although much has changed in publishing since then,  Bloomsbury remains true to its original publishing mission. The  current evolutionary phase is the digital resources growth strategy,  Bloomsbury 2020. This will accelerate the expansion of the Group’s  portfolio of high-quality digital products for academic libraries and  for professionals. To support Bloomsbury 2020 we are investing in  new products, technology platforms to fulfil them and B2B sales  processes.  Early in 2016, we simplified the organisational structure. The Group  now has just two publishing divisions, namely Consumer and Non- Consumer, supported by global functions for sales, marketing,  production, technology and finance. The new Consumer division  brings together, under Emma Hopkin, the Adult and Children’s  trade publishing divisions. This has coincided with Richard Charkin  reducing his time commitment to around two days a week. He  remains President of Bloomsbury USA, Chairman of Bloomsbury  India, and Managing Director of our Special Interest publishing. We  are delighted that Richard will remain on the Board. As explained in the 2016 Annual Report, the Board concluded that  it can best support the business as it evolves through a programme  of regular new Board appointments, while keeping the size of the  Board fixed at eight Directors. This will ensure that, at a time of  continual change in our markets, there is a steady inflow
