 CONTENTS OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS  » Feeds – headline operating profit of £1.5 million  (2016: £2.1 million). Good second half recovery,  having been impacted by margin pressure due to  increased commodity costs, particularly through  the winter months. Volumes were robust and the  mill developments in the North and Cheshire,  completed during the year, have strengthened  our operating platform.  » Food – headline operating profit of £3.0 million  (2016: £2.7 million). A strong result built on  efficiently delivering increased activity levels with  the business operating at capacity throughout  the year.  » Fuels – headline operating profit of £4.5 million  (2016: £3.9 million).

Over the last ten years we have seen solid  progress from the Group with revenue up from  £361 million to £556 million, headline profit before  tax up from £4.0 million to £8.5 million, headline  earnings per share up from 5.8p to a record 14.0p  this year and dividend per share up from 3.9p per  share to 6.0p per share.

Strong cash generation has allowed  this investment in the year whilst maintaining  a satisfactorily low level of net debt and a robust  balance sheet position. In 2017, the capability of
