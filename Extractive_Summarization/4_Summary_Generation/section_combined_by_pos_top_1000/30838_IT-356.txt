 Primary Statements 114 ITV plc Company Financial  Statements 179 Additional InformationGlossary 194 Strategic Report  The Strategic Report explains in detail how we have performed this year and sets out a fair review of the business,  a balanced and comprehensive analysis of our performance, the use of key performance indicators to explain the  progress we have made, a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company, and an indication of  potential future developments. The Strategic Report is prepared in line with the relevant provisions of the Companies  Act 2006 and the Company has had regard to the guidance issued by the Financial Reporting Council. It is intended  to provide shareholders with a better understanding of the Company, of its position in the markets within which it  operates, and of its prospects. In setting out the Company’s main risks and uncertainties, an indication of potential  future developments, and in other content, this report and accounts contains statements that are based on knowledge  and information available at the date of preparation of the Strategic Report, and what are believed to be reasonable  judgements, and therefore cannot be considered as indications of likelihood or certainty. A wide range of factors may  cause the actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contained within, or implied by, these various  forward-looking statements. None of these statements should be construed as a proﬁt forecast.
