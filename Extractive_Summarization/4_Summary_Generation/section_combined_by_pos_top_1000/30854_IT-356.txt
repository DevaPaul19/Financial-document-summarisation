Our second priority is to grow our ordinary  dividend in line with earnings through the  cycle. Over the past five years we have  grown our dividend by 6.1% p.a, during a  period of significant reinvestment. During  this period, we have delivered free cash  flow of more than 140% of our dividend,  demonstrating the cash generative nature  of our business model. Reflecting the continued confident  outlook for the medium term, the Board  is proposing a 5% increase to the full year  dividend to 15.85p per share for 2017   (2016: 15.10p per share).
