UK LOCATIONS AGRICULTURE EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION  HEAD OFFICE  AGRICULTURE  ENGINEERING ENGINEERING EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION Strategic Report / Corporate Governance / Financial Statements Carr’s Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 04 CHRIS HOLMES CHAIRMAN Chairman’s Statement REVIEW OF THE YEAR The financial year ended 2 September  2017 was a challenging year as the  Group’s financial performance was  impacted by external factors affecting  both divisions which were highlighted   in our trading update on 20 July 2017.  Despite this, the year was also one   of investment and significant progress  towards achieving the Group’s medium  term strategic objectives. In our Agriculture division, while the UK  business benefited from a recovery in  farmgate milk prices and consequently  improved farmer confidence, sales  volumes in our USA feed block business  were affected throughout the year by  lower cattle prices. This was partially  mitigated by a gradual recovery in the  second half which has continued into  the new financial year. In October 2017  we completed the acquisition of Pearson  Farm Supplies Ltd in line with our  strategy of strengthening our presence  in current locations. With the backdrop of this recovering  USA trading environment, the strategic  investment made in our new low  moisture feed block plant in Tennessee,  USA will provide us with access to new  geographic markets in the Eastern   and South Eastern states of the USA.   The plant is expected to be completed  before the end of December 2017   and following this the Group will have  comprehensive coverage of all the major  cattle areas in the USA.  In our Engineering division, we suffered  a significant setback during the year as   a result of a delay to the commencement  of a major contract and the poor  profitability of certain other contracts  during the period. As previously disclosed  in our trading update on 20 July 2017,  the delayed contract has now been  signed and work has begun which will  continue throughout the current and   into the next financial year.  During the year we also invested   in the acquisition of two engineering  businesses. In October 2016 we acquired  a German family-owned engineering  business, STABER GmbH, which designs  and develops specialised technology
