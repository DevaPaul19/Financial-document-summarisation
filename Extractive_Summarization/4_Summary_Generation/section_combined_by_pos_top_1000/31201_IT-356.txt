Telecom and Computing: Our products protect sensitive electronics  from the impact of waste energy (e.g.  escalating temperature and EMI issues),  ensuring maximum performance over the life of  the device. Growth is driven by ever-improving  functionality and increased data usage. 2. Mobile Devices: We create performance enhancing solutions  that enable an ‘always on’ world. Growth is  driven by demand for higher speciﬁcation,  thinner, lighter design as well as miniaturisation  of components and increasing device density. 3. Connected Transport: We help to redeﬁne mobility with smart  technology. Growth is driven by a widespread  increase in the deployment of connectivity  solutions in passenger cars, heavy equipment  and ﬂeet management. The emergence of   4G/LTE and the forthcoming evolution to  5G is driving automotive manufacturers to  upgrade their antennae to multiple input,  multiple output (MIMO) technology. 4. Connected Industry: We use industrial strength connectivity to  accelerate critical workﬂows. Growth is driven  by increased use of wireless automation  solutions that improve productivity in safety  critical environments.  5.

Focused on   performance for   stakeholders Interim dividend per share 1.13p  Basic earnings/(loss)   per share 15.8p  (2016: (31.8)p) Underlying basic earnings  per share† 11.1p +5.7% (2016: 10.5p)* AGM on 27.04.18 * 2016 earnings/(loss) per share has been restated for the 2017 rights issue.
