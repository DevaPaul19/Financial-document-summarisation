These  well-located assets are attractive to  customers and, with our expert  operational team managing the   properties directly, our portfolio   continues to outperform the market.  Our aim is to offer attractive homes to our  customers and provide a reliable service  for them. This means we have more  satisfied customers, who are staying with  us for longer, making sure our assets stay  in high demand. In turn, this generates  attractive and sustainable long-term total  returns for our shareholders. Like-for-like rental growth  3.3% Occupancy rate (PRS) 97 % Regulated tenancy portfolio Our portfolio of regulated tenancies  generates stable and reliable cash flow  of at least £100m per annum. Around 6.5% of our regulated tenancies  become vacant each year, enabling us to  capture the uplift from their tenanted  value to their vacant value as we sell them.  Returns from regulated tenancies are  generated in three ways: rental income,  capital growth and the reversionary  surplus (crystallising the reversion when  they become vacant). Our regulated  tenancy portfolio provides a resilient  rental income with growth linked to the  Retail Price Index, albeit with lower yields  than our PRS assets.  We are reinvesting these proceeds into  higher-yielding new PRS homes.
