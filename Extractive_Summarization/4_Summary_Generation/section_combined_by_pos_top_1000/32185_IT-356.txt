Overview Since setting out our Moving Up A Gear strategy 18  months ago, excellent progress has been made across  each of the five key pillars that underpin the strategy.  This has been reflected in robust sales growth, an  expanded knowledge of our customer preferences,  further improvements in service levels, many new and  unique product introductions, progress in building a  fit for purpose infrastructure and strong growth in our  value-added service offerings. T o this end, and on behalf  of the Board, I would like to thank our Management team  and our 10,000 plus colleagues for their hard work and  commitment in driving the business forward and for their  passion to help our customers on their journeys. Performance We achieved solid sales growth from our Motoring  activities, in both Retail and Autocentres, and strong  growth in Cycling where we continued to register  market share gains and can uniquely offer customers  the full range: from children’s balance bikes to high  end performance road bikes. Whilst the depreciation  in Sterling following the EU referendum and other cost  headwinds, such as the introduction of the National Living  Wage, clearly impacted earnings, the underlying business  performance was positive and cash flow was robust. We applied our capital allocation policy consistently:  firstly, by further investment in our colleagues and our  infrastructure; secondly, with an increased ordinary  dividend; thirdly, with two complementary acquisitions –  100% of T redz and Wheelies in May 2016 and a minority  stake in TyresOnTheDrive.com in January 2017; and,  thereafter, by paying a special dividend of 10 pence per  share in February 2017. Progress was thus made towards  our debt target of 1 times EBITDA. In line with our policy  of paying an increasing ordinary dividend, the Board has  recommended a final dividend of 11.68 pence per share,  payable in August 2017 which would result in a total full-year  ordinary dividend of 17.51 pence per share, up 3.0% over  the previous year. Investment in our colleagues continues to reap benefits  and I am pleased that Halfords was, for the 4th year in a  row, awarded an improved place in the list of T op 30 Best  Big Companies T o Work For. This was also confirmed by  an increased internally measured engagement score,  improved customer ratings and lower colleague turnover.  We are also proud of the recognition we have achieved,  and the awards won, for our community partnerships,  including many individual local projects, and for our work  in prisons to help provide employment to prisoners on  release. Our colleagues in Retail have progressed strongly  through the “Gears” training programme, gaining increased  pay awards and career development opportunities in  return. We also continued to invest in our leadership  development programmes and apprenticeship schemes. Outlook The year ahead brings challenges in the form of further  cost headwinds, particularly from a full year’s impact  in the fall in Sterling, and uncertainty around consumer  spending, but we approach these from a position of  strength. We hold leading positions in fragmented  markets, have detailed plans and initiatives to mitigate  cost headwinds and our growing service and services  propositions set us apart as a specialist retailer. It was disappointing that, earlier this month, our CEO Jill  McDonald tendered her resignation to take up a senior  role at M&S at the end of October. We are grateful for the  positive contribution she has made across the business  and she will leave Halfords with a clear direction to  drive future growth. The Moving Up A Gear strategy is  well underway and is delivering significant momentum  across the organisation. Crucially, we have a talented  group of engaged colleagues who remain focused on  implementing our strategy and providing customers with  the very best customer
