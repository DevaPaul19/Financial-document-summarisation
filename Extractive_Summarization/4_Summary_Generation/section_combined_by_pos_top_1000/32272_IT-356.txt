Since joining the Group in January 2017,  I have spent time getting to know our  two businesses, Express Gifts and Findel  Education. Both have leading positions  in their respective markets and have  strategies to build on the progress of  recent years, evolving their operating  models to cater for their customers’  future demands and ways of shopping.  I’m excited about the opportunity for  sustainable growth in a marketplace  for value‑ conscious customers who are  rapidly moving their purchases online,  although there is a significant amount of  further work required to achieve that goal. The new executive management team  that we announced at the start of April  2017, led by Phil Maudsley, have a wealth  of relevant experience that will be used to  deliver this growth. We have seen good progress in the last  financial year, with Express Gifts moving  its customer recruitment programme  to be all‑ year‑ round through a focus on  great‑value products and TV advertising.  A 17% increase in its customer base  to 1.6m indicates the success of that  approach, as this business continues  to drive the growth of the Group as a  whole. Findel Education completed  the consolidation of its warehousing  operations to improve future profitability  with no disruption to its supply chain.  Both businesses have increased their  capital expenditure on developing  digital solutions to make it easier and  more compelling for our customers  to shop with us. The Group has, however, produced an  outturn for the year that has once again  been below the expectations set internally  and externally at the start of the year.  It has also seen a high level and incidence  of individually significant items. We have  therefore introduced additional resource  into the relevant areas to improve upon  the setting and delivery of achievable  targets for future years. Financial performance Revenue^ for the Group grew by 10.2%  in the year on a like‑ for‑ like basis*  (11.3% on a reported basis for the  53‑ week period), with adjusted profit  before tax^* falling to £22.2m (2015/16:  £24.8m). The Group incurred individually  significant charges totalling £82.2m,  primarily relating to the cost of refunding  customers for their purchase of financial  services products from us in the past,  onerous leases, impairment of intangible  assets and additional provisions from the  adoption of our new bad debt provisioning  model. As such, the loss before tax for  the year was £59.4m. It should be noted  that the vast majority of the individually  significant items recorded in the year do  not lead to any incremental or accelerated  cash outflows. Core net debt* fell by
