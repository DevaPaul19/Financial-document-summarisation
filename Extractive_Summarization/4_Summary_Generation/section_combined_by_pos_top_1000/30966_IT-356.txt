 2 Camellia Plc is an international group – a global family of diverse companies with a 130-year history employing approximately 80,000 people worldwide. Our operations are in Agriculture, Engineering, Food Service and the holding of Investments. From the outset, Camellia’s ethos has been based on the highest moral and professional integrity, and a commitment to doing the right thing – ethically and commercially, globally and locally. Proﬁts are our lifeblood but not our soul. Our business is built on two fundamental principles: ■ Long-termism. We see ourselves as custodians, holding our businesses in trust for future generations. We believe we have a responsibility to ensure the stability, security and continuity of all our businesses, so they can be passed on to the next generation as enduring operations. We recognise that people and businesses take time to establish and grow to their full potential and we are happy to wait for that to happen. We are deeply committed to improving the long-term stability and well-being of our businesses, the communities and the environments in which we operate. ■ Sustainability. We are committed not only to the ultimate welfare of our employees but also to the communities in which they live. We believe our businesses can and should grow with respect and care for the environment rather than at the cost of it. We proactively invest in ensuring that the environments where we do business are continually protected and improved, and seek to minimise any damage our activities may cause. Our continuing business is made up as follows: Agriculture 2017: Turnover – £239.4 million, Trading proﬁt – £35.6 million Mature Immature area area Core crops Locations Ha. Ha.

There were no other signiﬁcant changes to the Group structure in the year; however in line with our strategy and as set out in more detail in the Chief Executive’s report, we made a small acquisition of a packet tea business in India during the year and since the year end we have acquired a majority shareholding in Jing Tea. Jing Tea is a UK based distributor of branded speciality teas to the retail and food service sectors internationally.  In pursuing our strategic objectives, we have decided to sell two of our smaller engineering businesses, BMT (Great Yarmouth) and GU Cutting and Grinding, although the sales have yet to complete. More details are provided in the Chief Executive’s report.  Trading in 2017 was mixed with a weak start being followed by a much better second half. Our tea operations performed well as good yields combined with an improving tea price as the year progressed. However, for the second year running, the macadamia crop was impacted by drought which led to disappointing volumes. Our speciality crops continue to provide an excellent return which once again demonstrates the beneﬁts of our diversiﬁed agricultural strategy. Elsewhere, as previously disclosed, our associate BF&M reported a signiﬁcant reduction in proﬁtability as a result of the two major hurricanes in September 2017. Camellia is a business with operations across a number of geographical areas, particularly in emerging markets, all of which are vulnerable to a global political atmosphere which is relatively unstable by recent historical standards. Furthermore, changing weather patterns led to a severe drought in the Cape and Kenya, ﬂooding in Bangladesh and an unprecedented hurricane season in the Caribbean. It is a credit to our staﬀ across the world that they continue to operate successfully in the face of these challenges. Board Members I was delighted to announce the appointment of Gautam Dalal to the Board as a non-executive Director with eﬀect from 1 March. Gautam’s wide experience of the markets in which we operate will be of great beneﬁt to the executive team. Dividend Your Board is recommending a ﬁnal dividend of 98p per share which, together with the interim dividend already paid of 37p per share, brings the total distribution for the year to 135p per share compared with 130p per share for 2016. Outlook As so much of our result depends on crop volumes in the second half of the year it is not possible to forecast outturns with any degree of conﬁdence. However, early signs of a better macadamia crop, some good prices for tea in the ﬁrst quarter of 2018 and continuing strength in our UK markets give us reasons to be optimistic at this stage. Staﬀ As always, my thanks go out to all our staﬀ for their eﬀorts in 2017.
