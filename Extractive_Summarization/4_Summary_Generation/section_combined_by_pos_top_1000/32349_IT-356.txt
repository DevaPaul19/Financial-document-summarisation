Our strategy is designed to offer shareholders  a combination of income generation and value accretion.  Strategic focus Hull and East Yorkshire is core to the strategic direction  of KCOM, and receives the majority of the Group’s investment.  We are fully committed to completing the fibre deployment  across our market to deliver premium services both to homes  and businesses. This should deliver long-term sustainable cash  generation, to continue to support our dividend policy.  Our Enterprise business is focused on market areas, where we  have seen good growth and where we have market leading skills.  We are targeting development in this area to provide momentum  in shareholder value. A key part of our growth this year comes  from additional business from existing customers who recognise  the value we can add to their business. This helps to give us  confidence that our strategy is the right one. The Board expects,  over the coming 24 months to see further substantial progress,  in support of this strategy.
