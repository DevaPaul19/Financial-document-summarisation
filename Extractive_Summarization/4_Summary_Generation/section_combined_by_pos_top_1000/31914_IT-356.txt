Acquisition of Danlind a/s On 4 September 2017, the Group announced the  proposed acquisition of the entire share capital of  Danlind a/s, a supplier of auto dishwash and laundry  products, based in Denmark. Danlind provides  McBride with access to accelerated growth in the key  strategic category of auto dishwash tablets, through  its well-invested capacity, technology platform and  high quality product range. Danlind has a significant  range of retail and contract customers along with a  well-established position in the Nordic region and in  the commercial laundry and dishwash markets. Danlind  will enable McBride to gain entry into growth segments  where it is currently under-represented. Additionally,  Danlind’s strong position in Ecolabel products can  be developed further through McBride’s extensive  European reach.  Danlind operates from three manufacturing sites in  Denmark, and has approximately 250 employees. For the  year ended 31 December 2016, Danlind reported revenues  of £58.4 million, EBITDA of £1.6 million, a loss before  tax of £1.3 million, and had gross assets of £48.0 million  as at 31 December 2016. For its financial year ending  31 December 2017, on a standalone basis, Danlind is  currently expected to generate c.£2.5 million of EBITDA.  McBride expects to realise significant commercial,  technical and operational improvement synergies  from the acquisition. The acquisition is expected to be  immediately earnings enhancing for the Group. Post-tax  return on invested capital is expected to meet cost of  capital in the third full year of ownership. Consideration of £10.8 million will be payable to  the shareholder of Danlind, Lind Holdings ApS, and  c.£28 million of net debt in Danlind will be assumed by  McBride at completion. The acquisition will be funded  from McBride’s existing banking facilities. The acquisition, which is subject to customary  regulatory and closing conditions, is expected to  complete in early October 2017. On completion, Danlind, the management team  and its employees will form part of the Household  products segment.  Results The past year has demonstrated further progress in  the quality of the Group’s profits and a step closer to
