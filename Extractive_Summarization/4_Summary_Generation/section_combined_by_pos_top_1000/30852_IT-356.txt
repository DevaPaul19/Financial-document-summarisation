This  reflected the strength of the  Group’s business model with its  broad spread of activities across  the marine sector, its strong  international presence and its  ability to innovate and grow new  businesses. Three of our four divisions improved their  results with Marine Support leading the  way with a 17% improvement in profits  generated by new markets in Brazil, the  Middle East and offshore renewables.  Specialist Technical delivered another  strong performance making good progress  with the delivery of its project pipeline and  the Indian submarine rescue contract in  particular. Tankships continued its run of  profit increases generated by high vessel  utilisation levels and careful attention to  costs. Offshore Oil managed a result only  marginally below the prior year: demand  began to firm in some sectors towards year  end while the division was also successful  in opening new opportunities in the Middle  East, Asia and in subsea decommissioning. Group revenue for the year grew by 9% to  £505.4m (2016: £466.0m). An increase in  the Group’s underlying effective tax rate  to 17.2%, (2016: 15.4%), held back the  increase in underlying diluted earnings  per share to 7% at 81.4 pence per share.  Statutory diluted earnings per share were  79.5 pence (2016: 78.7 pence). With a number of major projects  underway, careful attention has been paid  to managing cash flow this year in the  face of the expected increase in working  capital. This build-up squeezed our cash  conversion rate to 56% in 2017 and  despite this, the year-end balance sheet  gearing remained at a conservative 47%  (2016: 41%) with the ratio of net debt  (excluding bonds) to underlying earnings  before interest, tax, depreciation and  amortisation at 1.6 times (2016: 1.4 times). The underlying strength of the Group’s  performance and the positive outlook  for the year ahead has led the Board to  propose an increase in the final dividend to  19.3 pence (2016: 17.6 pence) per share  making a total for the year of 28.7 pence  per share, an increase of 10% compared  with 2016. Strategic overview Over the last ten years, with the exception  of 2015, James Fisher has increased its  profit and dividends every year, normally  by more than 10%: this despite external  events such as the financial crisis of  2007-8, the fall in oil prices in 2014  and most recently, Brexit. Key to this  performance has been the Group’s ability  to innovate and to build new businesses.  The rapid growth of our ship-to-ship  (STS) transfer business from 2007; the  development of a market-leading position  in submarine rescue and hyperbaric  engineering since 2012 and more recently,  the growth of a completely new activity  in offshore renewables have enabled the  Group to absorb these external shocks and  continue to grow. This growth in turn has  built an ever wider international presence,  so that the Group is not dependent on  any one geographical market. With a  stable management team in place and a  continued commitment to a decentralised  management structure which keeps  decision-making close to our customers  and markets, this track record of change  and innovation is set to continue. All four of our divisions are well placed for  the future. Marine Support is benefiting  from the opening of new markets for STS,  such as in Brazil, from the development  of its subsea project businesses, and  from its expanding presence in offshore  renewables. Specialist Technical has  market-leading positions in both its  hyperbaric and submarine rescue niches  and in its reactor decommissioning  business in the nuclear sector.  While this  division will always be project driven and  therefore ‘lumpier’ in terms of turnover  and working capital, it has an attractive  pipeline
