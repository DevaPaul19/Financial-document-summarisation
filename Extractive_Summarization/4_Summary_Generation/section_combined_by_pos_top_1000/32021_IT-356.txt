The performance has been good in all  operating divisions in the Company and  excellent progress has been made  against our strategic objectives.  I have been particularly impressed by the  pace of change in the business in recent  years as the team modernise the pubs  and brands portfolio and innovate to  address the continuous challenge to  enhance the customer experience.  Our growth primarily comes from  reinvesting year after year in our core  business and from driving ever greater  efficiency and excellence in execution.  This year has been notable for a strong  underlying performance, some excellent  work to enhance our own brand  portfolio, important steps to modernise  the brewing operation and a period of  significant investment with the  acquisition of 14 new pubs. The core strengths of Shepherd Neame   lie in a strong sense of family, a distinct  individual character, and a passion for  quality, for high standards and for   making continuous improvements   within a consistent strategic framework.   These characteristics deliver a strong and  sustainable business for the long-term  benefit of shareholders. Equally important  is our ability to take advantage of good  opportunities when they arise and to be  responsive to changes in the market.  Financial results Turnover for the period increased by  +11.7% to £156.2m (2016: £139.9m) driven  by the acquisitions and strong managed  house like-for-like growth of +8.1%.  Underlying operating profit grew by  +7.2% to £15.3m (2016: £14.2m).  Underlying profit before tax 1  grew by  +8.0% to £11.2m (2016: £10.3m) and  underlying basic earnings per share are  up +8.0% to 59.1p (2016: 54.7p).  Statutory profit before tax is down  -18.0% to £11.8m (2016: £14.4m),  predominantly because we achieved   an unusually high profit on disposal of  property in the prior year. Basic earnings  per ordinary share are down to 69.1p  (2016: 84.0p). Dividend The Board is proposing a final dividend  of 22.73p (2016: 22.05p) making the   total dividend for the year 28.35p  (2016: 27.50p), an increase of +3.1%.   This represents underlying dividend  cover of 2.1 times (2016: 2.0 times).   We will continue to target our dividend  cover at
