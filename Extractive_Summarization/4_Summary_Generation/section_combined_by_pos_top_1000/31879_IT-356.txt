Chairman’s statement This has been another   excellent year for the Group  across all key operational and  financial performance metrics.  John Allan Chairman 41.7p Total dividend per share  (2016: 30.7p) £ 1.4bn Capital Return Plan  over four years ending November 2018  based on consensus earnings This has been another excellent year for the Group across all key operational and  financial performance metrics. We achieved record profits, completion volumes were  at their highest level for nine years and we remain industry leading in terms of quality  and customer service.  We have delivered our FY17 financial targets of 20% gross margin and 25% ROCE,  and we are committed to further progress. Improving our profit margin remains a  priority for the Group and we have a number of initiatives underway to further increase  efficiency, reduce costs and simplify our business.

We were also  awarded the Home Builders Federation maximum five star rating for the eighth  consecutive year – the only major housebuilder with this record. We have now won 56  Built for Life accreditations for excellence in the design of homes and neighbourhoods,  more than all the other housebuilders combined.
