All major manufacturing sites certified to  OHSAS 18001.   Æ Completion of the consolidation of the European  Distribution Centre with the facility in Germany  and successful transfer of all UK Couplings  manufacturing into Cardiff.  Æ Significant increase in the Group’s capital  investment programme in the year to £10.9m.  Key projects delivered in the latter part of  the year will support further cost reductions,  improved operational efficiency and enhanced  product quality and service improvements.  Æ Investment in sales and marketing activities  in support of organic growth is demonstrating  results, particularly in Chain Europe.   Æ Successful disposal of the former European  Distribution Centre in Seclin, France. Completion  of the sale and short-term leaseback of the  Australian property at Mulgrave, Melbourne,  ahead of relocating the facility. Together, these  disposals generated net cash proceeds of £10.2m.  Æ Successful integration of Renold Tooth Chain  following last year’s acquisition. Renold Tooth  Chain continues to trade ahead of expectations. Chart shows an estimate of the average underlying monthly sales required for the  Group to deliver a breakeven adjusted operating profit. The estimate is based on  actual variable margin in the years in question so that when the actual fixed costs are  deducted the resulting adjusted operating profit is £nil. The resulting sales figure is  then divided by 12 calendar months to arrive at the level of monthly sales required  to breakeven. The breakeven point at March 2017 reflects the increased fixed cost  acquired with Renold Tooth Chain, along with increased commercial and marketing  activities. These factors increase the breakeven point, but are partially offset by  ongoing operational improvements.
