 Directors and Advisers IBC www.dillistonegroup.com 01 GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS STRATEGIC  REPORT Commenting on the results and  prospects, Mike Love, Non-Executive  Chairman, said: “The current trading performance of  the Group is positive with orders for  both Dillistone Systems and Voyager  Software ahead of the same period  in 2017 – with the former more than  25% up on the same period in 2017  and the latter having one of the best  quarters for new business orders in   its history.  Our GatedTalent product, launched  in October 2017, has been very well  received with a growth trajectory that,  we believe, will lead to it becoming the  dominant product in its market space  within a year.  Recurring revenues for 2017 were at  record levels and, despite the ongoing  investment in product development,  cash reserves have held up well.  Overall, despite the evident pressure  on new licence sales in 2017 and the  loss for the year of £0.071m, going  into 2018 the Group believes that it is  now in a stronger position in its core  markets than in recent years.  This confidence in the future allows  us to recommend a final dividend  of 0.5p and we anticipate reporting  further positive progress as the year  progresses.” OVERVIEW  ❯ Record level of recurring revenues 1 , of £7.474m, up 6% from 2016 with total revenue down  4% to £9.582m  ❯ Recurring revenues, representing 78% of Group revenue, covering 97% of Group  administration expenses before acquisition related and one-off costs  ❯ GatedTalent launched in October 2017 and which made an operating loss of £0.439m  ❯ Adjusted operating profit 2  fell to £0.309m (2016: £1.463m) before acquisition intangible write  offs and an adjustment for the loss of a contract in our Voyager division which totalled £0.823m  pre-tax  ❯ Loss for the year of £0.071m (2016: profit £0.526m)  ❯ Adjusted basic EPS 3  of 3.08p (2016: 7.10p)  ❯ A final dividend of 0.5p per share recommended (2016: 2.8p)  ❯ Cash funds at 31 December 2017 of £1.390m (2016: £1.537m) with borrowings of £0.391m  (2016: £0.158m)  ❯ New GatedTalent platform grows rapidly, with more than 160 contracted search firm clients   by 26 April 2018 and first revenues in 2018  ❯ Executive membership on the GatedTalent platform is both senior and diverse with CEO,  Managing Director and General Manager being most frequently referenced current position   and members registered from 75 countries.
