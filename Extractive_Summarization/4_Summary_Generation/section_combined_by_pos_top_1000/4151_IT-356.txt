 114 Section 172 statement  www.rotork.com  Rotork Annual Report 2022  01  Strategic report  Highlights  A strong set of results Rotork’s 2022 results were strong. Revenues increased 12.8% year-on-year, benefiting from higher selling price realisation and the second half’s strong recovery in deliveries. Adjusted operating margins recovered in the second half, however not sufficiently to fully offset the first half margin decline. In November we launched our Growth+ strategy which is designed to deliver on our ambition of mid to high single-digit revenue growth and mid-20s margins over time.
