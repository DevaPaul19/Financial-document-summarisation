In May we  were delighted to welcome Gestra to the  Group. Gestra’ s market-leading automated  boiler controls and strong market position in  Germany increases the market share of our  Steam Specialties division, improves access  to the German market and provides potential  to grow Gestra’ s presence outside its core  German market. T wo months later, in July,  electrical process heating and temperature  management solutions provider, Chromalox,  joined the Group. Industrial electrical heating  solutions are complementary to our steam  business and Chromalox’ s direct sales  business model, based around application  selling, diverse customer base and broad  market diversity, make it an ideal fit.
