Customer   touch points Unlike most of our competitors,  when lending direct we aim   to meet all our customers  face-to-face. The quality of our  customer relationships and how  we manage them are key drivers  of our long-term success. Online/by phone Our first point of contact is often by  phone or online when we confirm the  customer’s details and start the loan  application process. Face-to-face In branch-based lending and home  credit, meeting the customer face-to- face is an important part of our  lending process. Branch-based lending Everyday Loans The UK’s largest branch-based  provider of unsecured loans   to sub-prime borrowers. Guarantor loans George Banco and TrustTwo The clear number two player in   a fast-growing market. Home credit Loans at Home The UK’s third largest provider of  unsecured home credit.

Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 4 Chairman’s statement 2017 results The Group’s performance in 2017 was ahead  of our original expectations, driven by a  strong performance from Everyday Loans  and also by a sharp uplift at Loans at Home  which benefited from operational  challenges at a major competitor. It also  includes a maiden contribution from George  Banco whose results were consolidated from  the middle of August 2017. Reported revenues were £107.8m (2016:  £72.8m) and the Group produced an  operating profit of £3.8m (2016: operating  loss of £5.2m). Higher interest costs and the  impact of exceptional charges resulted in a  reported loss per share of 3.26p (2016: loss  per share of 2.60p). On a normalised basis and excluding  temporary additional commission, the  Group’s underlying performance was strong,  delivering a 35% increase in pre-tax profit to  £16.4m (2016: £12.1m) and earnings per share  of 4.25p (2016: 3.09p). Strategy Our strategy remains unchanged. We  remain focused on serving the needs of  consumers who are unable or unwilling to  borrow from mainstream institutions through  three distinct business divisions: branch- based lending, home credit and guarantor  loans. Each of these segments offers  significant opportunity for growth and  having already achieved our target of 20%  loan book growth across the Group as a  whole, we remain on course to also deliver a  20% return on assets in each of our  operating divisions. This will be achieved  through the execution of the three elements  of our business strategy: • Being a leader in our chosen markets;  • Investing in our core assets; and  • Acting responsibly.  Each of these is explained in more detail in  By phone Online Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 24 Group Chief Executive’s report 2017 Full year results A number of key operational and strategic  milestones were achieved in 2017:  Branch-based lending: • appointed Miles Cresswell-Turner   as CEO and strengthened the senior  management team • opened 12 new branches • launched two new products and added  77 new staff • processed over 1 million loan  applications for the first time Home credit: • promoted Davie Thompson to become  CEO and invested £5.3m to help drive   a 53% increase in the net loan book • opened 22 new
