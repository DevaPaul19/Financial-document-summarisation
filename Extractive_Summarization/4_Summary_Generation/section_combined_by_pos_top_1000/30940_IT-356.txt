Our franchisees are fully insured  members of professional bodies, supported  by specialist software, who know their   local rental market and manage all   properties locally. Estate Agency We operate on a no sale no fee basis. We  cater both for the majority of sellers who  prefer to instruct an agent operating from  high street premises and for the growing  segment of sellers who choose to use an  agent without a high street office. Two of our  brands have been engaged in estate agency  for more than 150 years. How we do it We rely on the motive power of local people  who are committed to operating franchises  under our brands to the highest levels of  professionalism and service. Our brands are  household names in their local communities,  regions and nationally. Whilst the majority   of franchisees operate through high street  offices and have been with us for many years,   a growing number of new franchisees choose  to offer a 24/7 online service though  EweMove. Our success We are a multi-award winning group with  recent successes including gold for EweMove  for best franchise estate agency at the   Sunday Times awards in 2016 and silver for  best franchise at the 2017 Negotiator awards.  Just as importantly we have grown the  revenue of our network of franchises through  joint effort and support year on year   since 2005. Where we focus  The Group has a strong  presence in lettings and  currently manages 52,000  properties on behalf of  landlords which amounts  to a town the size of  Gateshead.
