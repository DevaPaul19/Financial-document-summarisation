DEAR SHAREHOLDER, FY17 has been both a challenging and  rewarding year. We made our largest  acquisition ever in the US and have step- changed our UK business through organic  growth. There were some challenges in  delivering a programme of such complexity,  with an impact on operating leverage in the  period and with considerable investment   and restructuring charges incurred. However,  as a result of the significant activity delivered  in the year, we are now well positioned to  secure profitable growth and returns in the  coming years.  STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT In FY17 we made further progress in   achieving our vision to become a fast-growing,  international convenience food leader. This  vision and our strategy shape the direction   of the Group. A complete outline of our  strategic framework is provided on pages   13 to 17, with examples of how this was  implemented in FY17 and the priorities in  place for FY18. The key highlight of the year was the  completion of the acquisition of Peacock  Foods on 30 December 2016. The acquisition  transforms our market and channel position   in the US and has given us a growth platform  of real scale. The enlarged US business has a  well invested network, serving a diversified  customer base across multiple channels.  Integration is on track and the focus is on  exploiting the potential of the commercial  pipeline of outsourcing and innovation-led  opportunities.  *    The Group uses Alternative Performance Measures  (‘APMs’) which are non-IFRS measures to monitor the  performance of its operations and of the Group as a  whole. These APMs along with their definitions and  reconciliations to IFRS measures are provided in the  APMs section on pages 176 to 179.  5 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017 In the UK we strengthened our leadership  position in the food to go category with several  significant business wins and commercial  launches delivered to plan, and contracts  extended with core customers. We have  completed a phase of network investment in  Food to Go, and have added further capacity  through the acquisition of the Heathrow  facility. We have also made a substantial  investment in the UK ready meals network,   and have rationalised the UK portfolio with the  planned exit from the desserts manufacturing  business in Evercreech. Finally, we have begun  a process of streamlining our UK organisation  which will help underpin overall performance   in the medium term.  BREXIT Although the exact nature of changes to   come as a result of Brexit remains unclear,   the Board continue to monitor closely its  potential implications on the business,  including, in particular, any potential changes  to costs in the supply chain and the availability  and cost of labour. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE We assess financial performance across   the Group using a framework of profitability,  return and cash flow measures.
