When writing this statement last year,   our revenue growth expectation for the  year ahead was 37%, and the 58% growth  we actually achieved reflects the huge  effort made by our staff right across the  business, from the Board of Directors  and senior management, through to our  customer service and warehouse teams. International growth of 124% has been  particularly pleasing, and this is an area   in which we will continue to invest  significant effort and resource to improve  and increase our global reach, building  on the early success of our recently  launched Swedish and German  distribution operations. Notwithstanding the investment  necessary for our next phase of  expansion, the Board remains focused  on delivering profitable growth, and   as such is pleased to announce an  operating profit of £2.6m which is a  £1.7m (+192%) improvement on FY16’s  underlying operating profit (adjusted   to remove one-off IPO costs). This  translates into net profit of £2.3m   and earnings per share of 11.5 pence. In many ways, this has been a  transformational year for the business,  and to effectively manage further   growth and operational complexities   the Group formed an Operational   Board on 1 March 2017 to support and  complement the plc Board, comprising   a wide breadth and depth of operational  and commercial experience. To ensure we remain positioned for  further growth, the Group requires  additional head office capacity, and   the Board is delighted to announce a  property acquisition that provides an  excellent long-term solution to our  growth needs in our home city of York. In 2012, private equity firm Key Capital  Partners invested into the business,   and in October 2016 sold its final  shareholding. On behalf of the Board   I would like to thank them and Peter  Armitage, who represented Key Capital  on our Board, for their efforts and  support over the last four years. I’m also  delighted to welcome new institutions  and individuals onto our share register as  we embark on the next chapter in the  Gear4music growth story. Given the investments scheduled for   the current year to support continued  growth, the Board has decided not to  declare a dividend for FY17, but
