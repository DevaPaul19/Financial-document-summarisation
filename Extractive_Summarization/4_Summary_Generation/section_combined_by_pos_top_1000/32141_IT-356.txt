OVERVIEW  Helicalâ€™s core business is  developing and owning dynamic,  well located office space in  London and Manchester and also  includes a portfolio of logistics  units along the motorway  network of England and Wales.  With intelligent stock selection,  we aim to maximise returns by  development and refurbishment  as well as through significant  asset management initiatives.  THE  LONDON  MARKET In our judgement, the London commercial  property market currently provides the  best source of potential capital profits  and we expect this to remain the case for  the foreseeable future, notwithstanding  the risks associated with our exit from  the European Union and other potential  headwinds. In order for Helical to generate capital  profits the Company needs to identify  those areas where it believes tenant  demand is, or will become, strong and  to source opportunities in those areas  at an appropriate entry price.

The Company has recognised three  continuing major developments in the  London office market. First, the growth  of the London population, which  exceeded its previous peak during 2015.  Second, the continuing and rapid  expansion of the creative industries,  predominantly in technology and media.  Third, the migration of occupiers from the  West End to the City and
