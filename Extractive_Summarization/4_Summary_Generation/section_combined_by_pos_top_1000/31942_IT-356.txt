Revenue from continuing operations was steady compared with the prior  year, and the net loss for the year came in line with the Board’s expectations.   Financial results and condition   Revenues for the current year amounted to £2.00m, compared with £2.08m in the prior year (stated before  the IntelliSAW related license fee of £3.04m). Administrative expenses increased to £3.32m from £2.54m  in the prior year. This increase in expenditure reflects new product support and the commercial and  marketing activity within Translogik to launch iTrack II and deliver effective pre-contract engagement with  a number of key customers for this system.    The pre tax loss from continuing operations for the year was £2.16m compared with a profit of £1.59m  and loss in the prior year adjusted for the effects of the net IntelliSAW licence fee of £1.17m.  The total  loss attributable to shareholders was £2.17m (2016: profit of £1.15m) resulting in a net loss per ordinary  share of 22.84 pence (2016: earnings of 12.90 pence). The Board do not recommend payment of a  dividend (2016: Nil).  Net cash balances at 30 June 2017 were £2.52m (2016: £3.65m).   Strategy  The Group provides innovative sensor systems for various complex applications and operates two  principal businesses, SAWSense and Translogik.  The Group intends to continue to commercialise sensor technologies by working closely with global  partners in order to build value for shareholders through the generation and distribution of net income,  and/or the return of capital on realisation.  SAWSense designs and develops Surface Acoustic Wave (or “SAW”) sensor devices that can be used to  measure torque, pressure and/or temperature in harsh, restricted or demanding environments to very high  accuracy. This world leading technology has a broad range of potential uses ranging from premium value  custom applications through to high volume mass markets.  Translogik designs and markets a range of Tyre Pressure Monitoring Systems (“TPMS”), products and  services for heavy duty off road vehicles (particularly mine-haul trucks), commercial truck and bus as well  as passenger cars. These comprise the iTrack system, which provides real-time tyre temperature and  pressure measurements for mine-haul trucks in service, and a range of tyre probes and other offerings for  the road transport sector.   The Translogik product offerings are continually evolving with the focus on providing a comprehensive  service to clients in the mining and truck industry and this strategy has resulted in the successful launch  of the iTrack II system in September 2016.  Our markets  SAW sensing in global industries    Sensor technology is widely used in virtually every industrial application across a broad range of industries,  contributing to many billions of dollars in revenue. Sensors using SAW technology are powered by radio  frequency and do not require a battery and are wireless. This means that the sensor has significant  benefits, as the package can be extremely small and light and is suited to harsh environments or remote  locations, and does not require regular maintenance. Being wireless enables the sensor to be used in  rotating components, other moving parts, or environments where electrical wiring would pose a safety  risk.  These benefits are particularly appropriate in drives, motors, gearboxes, valves and couplings, which are  in common use in the industrial equipment, energy generation, oil & gas, aviation, military and automotive  sectors.  Transense Technologies plc  Annual report and financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2017      6  Chairman’s statement (continued)  As Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) seek ever more data on a real-time basis to optimise the  performance of their products, accurate and frequent measurement becomes increasingly important. The  world’s largest and most successful companies in these fields are recognising SAW as one of the enabling  technologies in developing the “Internet of Things” in this arena, contributing to a vision by which machines  are networked with embedded sensors to optimise performance using real time analytical tools, algorithms  and interactive controls.  TPMS in Mining    The original iTrack system was developed to provide tyre pressure and temperature monitoring data to  mine haul-truck operators, primarily to reduce or eliminate the incidence
