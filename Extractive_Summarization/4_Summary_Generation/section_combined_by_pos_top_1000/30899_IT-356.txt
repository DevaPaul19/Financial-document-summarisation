Projects are  monitored rigorously and  regularly, with consistent  processes and systems. Philip Aiken AM Chairman Chairman’s introduction balfourbeatty.com/AR2017 Governance Financial Statements Other Information 03 Strategic Report This is the third occasion, as Chairman  of your Board, that I have written to  you at the start of our Annual Report.  When we embarked on the Build to  Last transformation programme our  commitment was to make Balfour Beatty  a strong and sustainable company and  the sector’s leading performer.  Today Balfour Beatty is clearly focused on  its chosen markets, winning new business  on terms and conditions that balance  risk and reward. Projects are monitored  rigorously and regularly, with consistent  processes and systems. The legacy  contracts, which did so much damage  to your company, are largely completed.  This transformation has been  achieved whilst maintaining one of the  strongest balance sheets in the sector,  maximising value in our Investments  portfolio and paying a sustainable and  progressive dividend. It has been a long road, and we still have a  distance to go; but returning the Group to  industry-standard margins is now within  sight. I am proud of the progress we have  made so far. As we look forward with  conﬁdence to the rest of 2018 and beyond,  we will continue to Build to Last and  strengthen Balfour Beatty.  Performance Underlying proﬁt from operations more  than doubled to £196 million in 2017;  with all of our earnings-based businesses  reporting improved proﬁtability. The Group’s cash performance was strong.  During the year we had average net cash  of £42 million – compared to £46 million  average net debt in the previous year and  reported year end net cash excluding  non-recourse borrowings of £335 million.  Balfour Beatty has a number of outstanding  debt instruments: as a result of our strong  ﬁnancial performance we were able to pay  down some debt at the end of 2017 and  we intend to reduce gross debt further  in 2018. The Investments portfolio maintained its  Directors’ valuation at £1.2 billion, post  disposals. The partial sale of our holding  in the M25, London’s orbital motorway,  demonstrates our commitment to  maximise shareholder value, with the  sale price considerably higher than a  comparable market transaction from 2016. We have continued our practice of only  bidding for work on appropriate terms  and for those projects best aligned to  our capabilities. Our year end order book  was £11.4 billion.  Markets In the UK, US and the Far East,  governments are taking action to renew  and improve essential infrastructure –  work which Balfour Beatty is well placed
