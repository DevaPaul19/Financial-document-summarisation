Strategic progress The strategic plan set out by the  management team in May 2015 is  progressing well. Identity Solutions and  Product Authentication businesses  delivered strong revenue and operating  profit growth, further improving and  diversifying our business mix, while  the currency business performed  with resilience. In January 2017, we completed our first  acquisition in 14 years, adding DuPont  Authentication to the De La Rue family.  With a strong intellectual property  portfolio, global blue-chip customers and  a committed and experienced workforce,  it is an excellent strategic fit and will  be a great addition to the Group.  The banknote manufacturing footprint  restructuring programme is progressing  to plan. Our continuous focus on improving  efficiency and careful allocation of capital  has provided a solid platform to support  further growth.  We completed the sale of the  underperforming Cash Processing  Solutions business in May 2016.  Financial performance Revenue grew 2% overall, reflecting  the strong volumes from the Currency  segment and the good progress made  in the Identity Solutions and Product  Authentication businesses during the  year. Adjusted operating profit* was  similar to last year at £70.7m despite  the conclusion of a material security  features contract last year. On an IFRS  basis operating profit was £70.2m, up  from £66.8m last year, reflecting lower  exceptional charges in the current year.  Adjusted basic earnings per share*  decreased by 2% due to the benefit of a  non-recurring tax benefit in the prior year. Cash generated from operating  activities, which includes the impact  of discontinued operations, was up 9%  at £64.3m. The benefit of higher profits  in the year was offset by adverse working  capital movements due to the timing of  shipments and a reduction in advanced  payments. Following the $25m acquisition  of DuPont Authentication, which was  funded from the existing credit facility,  net debt as at 25 March 2017 increased  by £14.8m to £120.9m. Dividend In order to deliver long term shareholder  value and maintain financial flexibility  to sustain future growth, the Board  proposes to leave the dividend  unchanged and is recommending  a final dividend of 16.7p per share  (2015/16: 16.7p per share). This, together  with the 8.3p paid in January 2017,  will make a full year dividend of 25.0p  per share.  The Board The Board and I feel that we have the  right balance of skills and experience  to support the management team.  The appointment on 21 July 2016 of  Nick Bray, Chief Financial Officer of  Sophos Group plc, as a Non-executive  Director and Chair of the Audit Committee,  has further strengthened the Board.  Nick brings extensive experience in  the technology and information security  industries and we welcome him on board. Rupert Middleton, Chief Operating Officer  and Executive Director, has informed the  Board of his intention to step down from  the Board after the AGM on 20 July 2017.  We are grateful for his contribution and  wish him well for his future. The position  will be replaced by the newly created role  of Chief Operations Director which will  not be a Board position. A search has  commenced to identify suitable internal  and external candidates. Culture and people We are committed to fostering a  dynamic, agile and high performing  culture that drives the growth of the  business. Our people are critical to the  successful execution of our strategy and  to fulfilling our purpose. We continue to  engage with and invest in our people  through training and development.

While the results of the survey were  highly encouraging, we recognise  we have more to do in a number of  areas and the survey provides us with  invaluable insights to act upon.  142 Countries exported to in the last three years. 3,150 We employ around 3,150 people worldwide.
