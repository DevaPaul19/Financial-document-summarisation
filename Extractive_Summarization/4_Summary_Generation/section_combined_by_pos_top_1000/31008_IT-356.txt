The executive team responded well to  developments in a rapidly changing wealth management market,  and our investment managers achieved good risk-adjusted  returns for our clients in a time of great uncertainty and  persistently low interest rates.   UK and global investment markets performed well in 2017, with  some indices reaching record levels towards the end of the year.  This outcome has been positive for both Rathbones and our  clients, with the WMA Balanced Index up 7.2% in the year and   our funds under management reaching £39.1 billion, up 14.3% in  the year.   Profit before tax for 2017 increased 17.6% to £58.9 million after  incurring the costs associated with the relocation of our London  office and in pursuing strategic opportunities. These costs were  partially offset by a plan amendment gain arising from the closure  of our defined benefit pension schemes. Accordingly, basic  earnings per share of 92.7p in creased 17.5% from the 78.9p  reported last year. A full analysis of all non-underlying items  impacting profit before tax
