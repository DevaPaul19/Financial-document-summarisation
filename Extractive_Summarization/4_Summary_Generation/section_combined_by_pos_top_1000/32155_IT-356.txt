The Report sets out information on the Burberry brand, business operations,   strategy, people and responsibility activities. The following messages from Sir John Peace and Christopher Bailey highlight   Burberry’s performance during the year and the outlook for the Company. Good early progress against Burberry’s ambitious plans. Sir John Peace Chairman As Carol Fairweather and John Smith had signalled   their intention to step down as Chief Financial Officer   and Chief Operating Officer respectively, focus was   also on the succession of these roles, with the decision   to combine them to align with the change programme. The Board unanimously supported the appointment of  Marco Gobbetti as Chief Executive Officer who will join   the Board on 5 July 2017 (with Christopher transitioning   to his new role at that time), and Julie Brown who joined   the Board as Chief Operating and Financial Officer on   18 January 2017. The Board believes that the combination   of Christopher’s creative talent and vision for Burberry   and Marco’s extensive skills in luxury and retail, as   well as Julie’s financial and commercial track record,   will provide strong leadership for the next phase of  Burberry’s evolution.  The Board would like to thank Carol Fairweather for her  immense contribution to Burberry over the past ten years,  and John Smith for his contribution to Burberry over the  past seven years, first as a non-executive director and  latterly as Chief Operating Officer. We wish them all the  best for the future. Financial performance and shareholder returns As a whole, the luxury sector has continued to remain  challenging during the year, with some signs of  improvement during the second half. We have made  strategic long-term choices to strengthen the brand   and reposition Burberry for growth over time, and good  progress with the implementation of our programme  including the establishment of our five key pillars to  underpin our growth and productivity agenda. More   detail on our progress is set out in Christopher’s letter   and in this Report. Burberry has delivered 2016/17 revenues of £2.8bn   (down 2% underlying), and adjusted profit before tax of  £462m (up £42m and down 21% underlying). This was in  part impacted by a decrease in licensing profit due to the  planned expiry of our Japanese licences and other actions  we have taken to build and reinforce our brand positioning.  We also delivered the planned £20m of cost savings in   FY 2017. This is expected to build to c. £50m in FY 2018  and is on track to deliver the target of at least £100m  annualised in FY 2019. Last year I highlighted the fundamental changes taking  place in the luxury sector and in consumer behaviour.  These were influenced by a challenging global environment,  which had impacted the performance of the sector as a  whole, as demand slowed sharply in many of Burberry’s  key markets. To stay ahead of these changes and to   create future value for shareholders, we announced an  acceleration of our productivity and efficiency agenda,  particularly looking at our ways of working. We identified  significant future organic revenue growth opportunities   and a programme of actions to deliver at least £100m of  annualised cost savings by FY 2019.  The Board also considered with Christopher Bailey, the  shape of the leadership team required to maximise our  growth opportunities and to successfully implement these  plans. It was concluded that there was a need for a new  chief executive with strong luxury retail experience to lead  on the commercial, operational and financial elements of  the business, who could partner closely with Christopher,  who would continue his leadership of the brand and design  elements of the business as President and Chief Creative  Officer. Since taking on the combined role of Chief Creative  and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher has made  significant progress against a backdrop of challenging  market conditions. The Board is appreciative of his efforts  in working with the Board to identify a new chief executive   to partner with him
