The underlying business has performed well and  there have also been a number of individually  important strategic transactions.  ALAN AUBREY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 2017 has been a significant year for IP Group.   The underlying business has performed well and there  have also been a number of individually important  strategic transactions. The Group completed two  corporate transactions: the combination with AIM- listed Touchstone Innovations plc in October and  the acquisition of Parkwalk Advisors Ltd in January.  Touchstone Innovations creates, builds and invests in  technology companies and licensing opportunities  developed from scientific research from the ‘Golden  Triangle’, the geographical region broadly bounded  by London, Cambridge and Oxford and Parkwalk is  the UK’s leading university spin-out focused EIS fund  manager. In addition, IP Group completed a placing  to raise £181.0m of new capital and extended its  model into Australasia, signing a landmark agreement  with nine of Australasia’s leading universities: the  University of Adelaide, Australian National University,  the University of Melbourne, Monash University,  UNSW Sydney, the University of Queensland, the  University of Sydney and the University of Western  Australia in Australia, and the University of Auckland  in New Zealand. The Group now has operations in  three major geographic territories – the UK, US and  Australasia, a stronger balance sheet and a large and  diversified portfolio of exciting opportunities. What are the main benefits of  the combination with Touchstone  Innovations? Our vision is to create an international leader in IP  commercialisation with an enlarged platform for  growth and investment. The three most significant  benefits to the Group of the combination with  Touchstone are: (1) increased scale and critical mass;  (2) further diversification of the Group’s portfolio  in terms of maturity and business sector and (3)  further access to world-class research, including  London’s Imperial College and University College  London. As a result of the transaction, the Group  now operates the ‘technology transfer operation’  known as ‘Imperial Innovations’. It also brings with it a  number of experienced team members. We continue  to believe that an ‘industry champion’ will be better  placed to attract the best university partnerships;  the best scientific and commercial talent; and a  broader and deeper pool of investors. By creating  a stronger, better-resourced company, we can help  more scientists develop commercial businesses,  and help prevent the flight of commercially viable  enterprises that so often has to leave the UK and/ or seek takeover before they have achieved what  they set out to do. The transaction was declared  wholly unconditional in October and Touchstone is  consequently being integrated into the Group. What is Imperial Innovations? Imperial Innovations is Imperial College, London’s  ‘Technology Transfer Office’ or ‘TTO’ for short.  University TTOs are dedicated to identifying  research which has potential commercial interest  and to then helping commercialise it. Following  the Touchstone transaction, Imperial Innovations  is now a wholly owned operating unit of IP Group  and effectively gives the Group a direct pipeline to  the research being carried out at one of the world’s  leading technical universities until mid-2020. Imperial  Innovations works with researchers at Imperial  College London to help develop their
