Corporate Corporate Highlights Our AUM increased 27% over the year in Sterling terms and 12% in Dollar terms. The increase in  AUM was due entirely to market and currency movement as it was another year of net outflows  from our funds. The level of net outflows of £230m was however markedly lower than last year  and over the second half of the year we returned to net inflows.
