The Group delivered an outstanding  performance in 2017 , increasing  profit before taxation by 44% (50%*)  to a record £40.6m (2016: £28.1m).  All of the Group’s regions delivered  increases in both gross profit (net fee   income) and operating profit and 71%   (2016: 69%) of the Group’s net fee  income is now derived from overseas  businesses.   Revenue was up 17% (14%*) to £1.2bn (2016:   £1.0bn) and net fee income increased by  24% (20%*) to £345.2m (2016: £278.3m).  Operating profit was up 60% (54%*) to  £41.9m (2016: £26.2m) and earnings per  share increased by 55% to 42.9p per share  (2016: 27.7p per share).  The Group further strengthened its balance  sheet with net cash of £31. 1m as at 31  December 2017 (31 December 2016:  £22.5m). The Group’s ratio of permanent  and contract recruitment net fee income  is 68% permanent to 32% contract (2016:  69%:31%). During the year, headcount increased by  17% to 3,793 (2016: 3,229).

The Board will be recommending a 50%  increase in the final dividend to 9.3p per share   which combined with the interim dividend  of 2.75p per share would result in a 42%  increase in the total dividend to 12.05p   per share (2016: 8.5p).  In 2017, the Group purchased 2.1m shares  at an average price of £3.79 for £8.0m, which   were subsequently cancelled. An additional   0.4m shares were purchased at an average  price of £4.03 for £1.8m through the Group’s  Employee Benefit Trust. The Board is  authorised to re-purchase up to 10% of  the Group’s issued share capital and will  be seeking approval for the renewal of this  authority at the Annual General Meeting   on 17 May 2018. As recently announced, I will be stepping  down from my role as the Group’s Non- Executive Chairman on 1 March. It has been   a privilege to serve on the Board for the past   five years and I have absolutely no doubt that   the Robert Walters Group will continue to go   from strength to strength. I would like to take   this opportunity, one final time, to thank all  of the Group’s staff for their hard work and
