Our mission is to make families and friends  happy; to entertain and enthral profitably.  The way that people and families interact  has changed rapidly in recent times and  we are able to bring families and friends  together to play, and to have fun in a very  modern way through the Tenpin brand.  Our growth strategy is designed to support  and strengthen our business model, and is  focused on three simple routes: incremental  organic growth; growth through acquisition;  and ongoing investment into both our  estate and into our support platform.  This is because firstly, many more marginal  gains exist across our operations; secondly,  because value has been proven in acquiring  single units, converting them to “The Tenpin  Way” and of course accruing scale benefits;  and lastly, because sustainability of profit  growth derived from the lifeblood of a steady  drip feed of capital to maintain modernity  and relevance to our consumers and attract  high-quality operating talent. The logic is  entirely evident. We have made very good progress with  this strategy during recent years. Our self-managed growth strategy  is clearly defined and is driven by the  three routes, but we are also determined  to see our available market grow as  consumers gain enthusiasm for spending  time and their income on more experiences  and less traditional product purchases.  Ten Entertainment Group operates with a  simple, profitable, proven business model  and with a proposition that is entirely  customer driven, underpinned by a  strong culture formed and protected  by our colleagues.  2017 was a year of significant progress for  the Group with the successful listing on the  Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. During April 2017, we welcomed our new  shareholders to benefit from our robust,  de-leveraged but growing business. Ten Entertainment Group plc has  performed well during FY17: good  like-for-like sales growth again, the  successful completion of a further three  acquisitions and refurbishments at six  of our centres. Following the successful  pilot of a business transformation project,  Pins & Strings, we are now extending this  technology into ten more of our locations in  2018 and in time, across each of our venues.  The combination of these achievements  has resulted in strong EBITDA growth  of 14% during the year and therefore we  can confidently propose a payment of a  maiden full-year dividend. I am pleased  to report Group adjusted earnings per  share of 16.2p. A key aspect of our sustained and  most recent performance is our highly  experienced and motivated leadership  team, together with a very special culture  which is focused on delivering consistently  great experiences for our customers.  One way we can see this is the most crucial  measure: our impressive, sector-leading  Net Promoter Score of 66%, up from 49%  in 2016. We know it is a crucial correlate  to sales growth, and therefore core  underlying profit growth. I believe operating teams across the  Group, served by the senior leadership  team and support group, has the right  skillset to execute the Group’s strategy,  deliver significant further growth and drive  strong returns for shareholders. On behalf  of the Board, I would like to personally  thank all of our teams and colleagues  across the Group for their
