We have improved store profitability and have also   made progress in the development of our online channel  although there is still considerable work to do. Our est1897.co.uk site for watches is a great example of how we  can successfully use the internet for retailing backed up by our  store network. The opportunity to build on this concept for our  core services is clear and will be a key part of our future strategy.  These activities have repositioned the business within the wider  alternative credit market and allowed the Group to access   a broader customer base. The Board ensures that this growth   is carefully managed with a clear focus on the changing risks,  both regulatory and financial, that this diversification brings. The growth in retail, FX and buyback also provide a degree   of resilience to changes in the marketplace.  Financial performance  The Group delivered profit after tax of £11.3m (2016: £7.6m) and  diluted earnings per share of 30.94 pence (2016: 20.88 pence).  Subject to shareholder approval, a final dividend of 6.2 pence  per ordinary share (2016: 5.3 pence) will be paid on 1 June 2018   to those shareholders on the register at the close of business   on 4 May 2018. This will bring the full year dividend to 10.5  pence per ordinary share (2016: 9.2 pence). The Group’s financial position is strong with growth in the  combined personal loan and pawnbroking loan books (net) to  £63.8m (31 December 2016: £50.2m). As a result net debt increased  to £13.3m at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: £5.4m).  At year end the Group had available headroom of £8.0m on its  £30m borrowing facilities. I am pleased to report that in March  2018 the facility was increased by £5.0m. Regulation H&T is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct  Authority (FCA) for all consumer credit business. During the   year the FCA conducted a consultation on creditworthiness   and is expected to publish the results in 2018. We engaged with the FCA through our trade associations and  have analysed the proposals contained within the consultation.  The consultation provides helpful guidance on effective  creditworthiness assessments and clarifies some of the specific  exemptions in relation to pawnbroking. Subject to the final  policy statement we do not expect it to have an adverse impact  on our business. We fully support the higher standards that the  consultation aims to deliver.  Strategy We are developing our capabilities to address a changing market  where we see pressures both on the high street in general and  the core product of pawnbroking in particular. We are focussed  on maximising the potential from the core services while  investing in the development of new products and channels.  This approach will allow us to improve profitability in the   short term; in the longer term we can access a wider customer  base and provide those consumers with products appropriate   to their needs. We believe that our network of stores supports this  development, whether through click-and-collect from the  est1897 website or by providing a face-to-face underwriting  decision for customers we cannot serve with an online loan.  This real-world presence supported by an effective online and  mobile proposition creates an important distinction between  H&T and a purely online business. In developing our personal loan product, we have a clear  objective to provide our customers with a route to lower  interest rate credit products as their relationship with H&T  develops. We believe that this progression is beneficial to the  customer, builds loyalty and meets the high standards required  in this regulated marketplace. Prospects The overall weakness in sterling following the EU referendum  result has continued to benefit the sterling gold price for much  of the year; this in turn provides an improvement in the Group’s  profits while it continues. Demand for our services remains  strong and the development in our products and distribution  enables us to capture a larger share of
