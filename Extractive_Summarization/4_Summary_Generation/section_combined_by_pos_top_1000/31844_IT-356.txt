ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 10 Following the strong performance in the  year ended 30 July 2016, I am very pleased  to report further growth across the  business for the year ended 29 July 2017,  despite challenging economic conditions. Financial and strategic objectives The Group continues to pursue the  following objectives: • Deliver profitable and sustainable  growth; • Improve the quality of earnings;  • Improve business resilience through   the economic cycle; and • Increase shareholder returns. The business has continued to deliver  against these objectives, growing revenue  and gross profit, diligently controlling  costs and maximising cash flow. I am  particularly pleased with this result given  the toughening trading environment   since the turn of the year, and believe it  demonstrates the increasingly resilient  business we are building and the  commitment of our Board and staff   to achieving the objectives we set. A clear strategy for  growth, underpinned   by strong cash flows and  increasing resilience Chairman’s Statement Reaching the milestone of 100 ScS stores  was a further highlight of this financial  year,
