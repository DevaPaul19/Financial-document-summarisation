It starts by building   a large installed base of original  equipment used in highly abrasive  operating environments. This, in turn,  drives demand for spares and services,  providing earnings resilience in the  diversified markets the Group serves. In  2017, 69% of revenues were generated  from aftermarket activity, with 31%  from original equipment. 39% were  generated in emerging economies.

Intensive aftermarket care We provide solutions that are used   in some of the world’s most  extreme operating environments.
