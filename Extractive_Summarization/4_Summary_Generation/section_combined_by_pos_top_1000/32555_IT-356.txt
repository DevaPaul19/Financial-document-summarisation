In the 52 weeks to 24  March 2017 sales rose by 6.7% to £5.3bn  and operating profi t rose to £176.1m.  Customer satisfaction was strong.  The fi nancial performance was good  and the Group ended the fi nancial  year with net cash of £160.7m. Our  ‘Drive’ plans are working well with  progress on the catering and retail sides  of the business. Our like-for-like sales to  caterers were up by 4.4%. Our like-for-like  sales to retailers declined by 0.6%  primarily due to tobacco legislation.  The plans to ‘Broaden’ the business  are going well. In the 52 weeks to 24  March 2017 Booker distributed £2.3bn  of product to our customers’ premises  versus £1.8bn last year as we continue  to expand our delivered service. Digital  sales were £1,072m compared to  £979m in the previous year and Booker  India is making progress.  On 14 September 2015, Budgens and  Londis joined the Group. They are  performing well. Basic earnings per share were 8.66  pence, up from 7.24 pence last  year. Given the strong operational  performance and cash fl ow of the  business the Board recommends the  payment of a fi nal dividend of 4.97  pence per share (2016: 4.03 pence per  share) which, together with the interim  dividend, makes a total dividend for the  year of 5.60 pence per share (2016: 4.60  pence per share). The fi nal dividend is  payable on 7 July 2017 to shareholders  on the register on 9 June 2017. In addition to the fi nal dividend, the Board  is recommending a special dividend  to shareholders of 3.02 pence per  ordinary share (at a cost of approximately  £54m, based on the current issued  share capital of the Group). This follows  the capital return of 3.20 pence per  share to shareholders in July 2016 and   3.50 pence per share in each of July  2014 and July 2015.  I should like to thank all our colleagues  for their contribution to the success of  the Group in the year just ended. On 27 January we announced the  planned merger with Tesco to form  the UK’s leading food business.  This combination should improve  choice, quality, prices and service  for the UK consumer. It should also  help the Booker catering, retail and  small business customer prosper in a  challenging market. We are continuing  to assist the UK competition authorities  in their ongoing consideration of the  merger and it is expected that the  merger will complete in late 2017 / early  2018, subject to, amongst other things,  the necessary shareholder approvals.  During this process Booker will ensure it  is “Business as Usual”. We are excited by  the opportunities the merger creates for  consumers, our customers, suppliers,  colleagues and shareholders. Outlook The Group’s revenue in the fi rst seven  weeks of the current fi nancial year is  ahead of last year.   As a result of the proposed merger,  we  are in an offer period as defi ned in the  Takeover Code.  We will not be making  forward looking statements for the  duration of the offer period. Annual General Meeting Our Annual General Meeting will be held  on 5 July 2017. The notice of Annual  General Meeting will be issued to  shareholders in due course.
