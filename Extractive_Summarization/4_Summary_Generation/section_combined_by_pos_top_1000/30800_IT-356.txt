As we stated in our IPO Prospectus,  the Directors support high standards  of corporate governance and it is a  policy of the Company to comply with  current best practice in UK corporate  Governance to the extent appropriate  for a Company of its size.  ContourGlobal listed its Ordinary  shares on the Main Market of the  London Stock Exchange on  14th November 2017. The Listing Rules  of the Financial Conduct Authority,  including the UK Corporate  Governance Code (the “Code”), have  therefore applied to the Company  since that date. In the months leading  up to the listing, much work was  carried out to ensure that the Board  had constituted appropriate  Committees and adopted relevant  policies and procedures to support  the development of a robust  governance structure and compliance  with the Code and other obligations of  a Company listed on the London Stock  Exchange’s Main Market. Since listing ContourGlobal LP  (ultimately owned and controlled by  Reservoir Capital) continues to be the  majority shareholder of the Company.  The Board believes that the Board and  the Board Committees, with the addition  of the new independent Non-Executive  Directors will provide the appropriate  corporate governance balance in light  of the interests of both the majority  shareholder and the new minority  shareholders. The Remuneration and  also the Audit and Risk Committee  consists solely of independent  Non-Executive Directors and a  Relationship Agreement is in place  between the Company, ContourGlobal  LP, the Reservoir Funds, Reservoir  Capital and the Company President  and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph C.  Brandt (the Relationship Agreement). Under the Relationship Agreement  Reservoir Capital is able to appoint  two Non-Executive Directors to the  Board while it continues to control  25% or more of the Company’s shares.  Further details of the Relationship  Agreement can be found on pages 57  and 81. The first such appointees by  Reservoir Capital are myself and  Gregg M. Zeitlin. As Co-Chief Executive  Officer of Reservoir Capital, I therefore  did not meet the independence criteria  set out in the Code.
