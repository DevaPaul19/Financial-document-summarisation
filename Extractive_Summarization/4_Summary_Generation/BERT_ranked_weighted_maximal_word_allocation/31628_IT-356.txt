By broadening  its product suite, II has pivoted away from  its traditional publisher status to a business  where over 80% of its revenues are derived  from non-publishing activities. II has  invested in its proprietary ManagerMatch  platform, helping investors find fund  managers more efficiently and it is designed  to become an integral part of investors’  manager diligence and selection processes. The Group also increased its investment  in Zanbato, a Silicon Valley tech company  whose mission is to create greater liquidity  in private markets by developing a  pioneering electronic Alternative Trading  System, ZX, focused on providing exchange- like functionality to institutional trading  of blocks of private securities. These are  examples of investments to capitalise  on the technological changes that will  transform capital placement in the asset  management industry. EVENTS: ACQUIRING TO EXPAND  INTO NEW MARKET SEGMENTS At the Investor Day in March 2016 we  outlined the potential of telecoms as one  of our big investment themes because of a  rapidly expanding market and the ability to  develop new products and services around  our TelCap business. We have chosen to buy  (rather than build) to move into adjacent  markets to TelCap and as a result invested  in BroadGroup and Layer 123. BroadGroup organises data-cloud events  and specialist advisory services. Its primary  event, DataCloud Europe, is held annually  in Monaco and brings together leading  carriers, data-centre providers, cloud- storage providers and systems integrators  to develop business and to network. Layer123 organises leading network- innovation events around Software- Defined Networks and Network Functions  Virtualisation in Europe and America. In addition, Layer123 delivers content to  its large community of network-strategy  professionals. When CEO  Andrew Rashbass defined our new strategy in March 2016,  we said that 2017 would be a year of transition with a return  to growth in 2018. Our 2017 results actually show a year of  “transition plus”, using the strong US dollar to invest in our  business and still deliver improved results compared with last  year. Equally, the reorganisation
