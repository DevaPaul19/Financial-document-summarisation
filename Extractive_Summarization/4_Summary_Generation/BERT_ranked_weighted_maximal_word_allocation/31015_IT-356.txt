All businesses are facing challenges driven  by the constantly evolving digital backdrop  and the increasing competition for attention  and performance. Centaur is successfully  managing its own adaption to this changing  landscape by reducing its exposure to print  advertising and growing its higher quality  digital recurring revenues. The Group has invested in building an  outstanding portfolio of business intelligence  products that helps its clients by providing  valuable information, analytics and insight,  allowing them to maximise the value of this  through advisory services, media channels  and events to help connect with their  customers. In the relatively short period that I have   been Chairman, my time has been spent  learning about the business, the market  dynamics and the opportunities ahead. I have been impressed by the quality and  commitment of the team across all areas. I am still in the process of fully understanding  every aspect of the Group, and this is  my immediate focus. However, my first  impressions are that there is clear potential  and I am confident we can build on the  transformation work already completed and  take the business forward both organically  and through further strategic acquisitions. Group performance  It has been a satisfactory year in terms of  underlying 1  performance with our continuing  operations reporting an adjusted operating  profit² of £4.1m in the year against £4.2m in  2016. Following our strategic decision to dispose  of our last B2C segment, Home Interest, we  recorded a £20.9m profit on disposal of this  area of our business. This drove a reported  total comprehensive income of £21.9m for  the year. Fully diluted earnings per share  were 14.3p (2016: (3.8p)). Cash generation has remained excellent  over the year and I am pleased to report  continued excellent progress so far in 2018. Strategic progress 2017
