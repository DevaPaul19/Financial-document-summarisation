 HIGHLIGHTS TRANSITION COMPLETED Operational and strategic highlights • The Company’s transition to a fully self-publishing  business model was completed in November 2016  with the successful launch of Frontier’s second  franchise, Planet Coaster. In July 2017 Planet Coaster’s  first paid additional downloadable content was launched. • Elite Dangerous, which launched in December 2014,  continues to perform well. Frontier’s next major game franchise, based on  the Jurassic World movie franchise, was revealed  in August 2017. This will improve and accelerate Frontier’s growth  into the key Chinese market and help drive scale-up  of the business. Operating profit grew by 550% to £7.8 million  (FY16: £1.2 million) representing an operating  margin of 21% (FY16: 6%) and EBITDA increased  to £12.7 million (FY16: £4.9 million). • Following the  £17.7 million strategic investment by Tencent the  Company’s cash balance was £27.5 million on  31 August 2017.
