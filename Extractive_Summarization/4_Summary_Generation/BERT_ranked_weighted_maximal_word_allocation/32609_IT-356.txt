I  am  pleased  to  report  a  strong  performance  for  the  year  ended  31  January  2017. Gross  profit  rose  by  16.3%  to  £31.7m,  underlying  profit  before  tax  increased  by  17.2%  to  £5.1m  and  reported  profit  before  tax  by  38.6%  to  £4.3m. As  I  have  mentioned  in  prior  reports,  in  2014  we  took  a  thoughtful  and  critical  look  at  our  industry  to  evaluate  not  only  our  own  market  position,  but  the  challenges  and  opportunities  that  lie  ahead. This  year,  the  results  of  this  long-term  strategy  are  beginning  to  emerge.
