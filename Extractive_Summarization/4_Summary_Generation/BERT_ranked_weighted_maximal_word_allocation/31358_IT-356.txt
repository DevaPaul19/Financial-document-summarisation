 Directors and Advisers IBC www.dillistonegroup.com 01 GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS STRATEGIC  REPORT Commenting on the results and  prospects, Mike Love, Non-Executive  Chairman, said: “The current trading performance of  the Group is positive with orders for  both Dillistone Systems and Voyager  Software ahead of the same period  in 2017 – with the former more than  25% up on the same period in 2017  and the latter having one of the best  quarters for new business orders in   its history. Our GatedTalent product, launched  in October 2017, has been very well  received with a growth trajectory that,  we believe, will lead to it becoming the  dominant product in its market space  within a year. Overall, despite the evident pressure  on new licence sales in 2017 and the  loss for the year of £0.071m, going  into 2018 the Group believes that it is  now in a stronger position in its core  markets than in recent years. This confidence in the future allows  us to recommend a final dividend  of 0.5p and we anticipate reporting  further positive progress as the year  progresses.” Read more on Group Performance  on pages 08 to 14 Investor  relations  website Visit our investor relations website at   www.dillistonegroup.com for further   information about Dillistone Group Plc.

The Board has raised £0.400m from the  Directors and PDMRs (person discharging  managerial responsibilities) in the form of a  convertible loan note to provide continued  funding for GatedTalent. The loan note has a 3-year  duration but with various rights for early  conversion or repayment. However we propose paying  a final dividend of 0.5p (2016: 2.8p) subject  to Shareholder approval. The dividend will  be payable on 13 July 2018 to Shareholders  on the register on 15 June 2018. It is through their efforts, commitment and  determination that we continue to be a leading  technology provider in the sectors we serve. After a slow January, orders for Dillistone  Systems’ FileFinder product improved  significantly in February and March and ended  the quarter more than 25% up on the same  period in 2017.
