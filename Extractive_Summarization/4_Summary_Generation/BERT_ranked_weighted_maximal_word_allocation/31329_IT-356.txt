 Chairman� s statement Overview Following the sale of our Adult Services  business to Cygnet Health Care Limited  (Cygnet), a wholly owned subsidiary of the  US company Universal Health Services, Inc.  at the end of 2016, Cambian became a pure  children’s specialist education and behavioural  health services business, offering a full range  of essential services from therapeutic fostering  through to specialist schools and residential  care. We have also spent 2017 repositioning the  business towards a differentiated integrated  recovery model incorporating care, education  and therapy for children with the highest needs,  which is where we believe there is a significant  shortage of care and education facilities. We are confident that we  now have the right senior management team  to successfully manage and grow the business. At the conclusion of the Company’s Annual  General Meeting on 5 June 2017, both Alison  Halsey , Chair of the Audit Committee, and  Chris Brinsmead, Senior Independent Director  and Chair of the Remuneration Committee,  stepped down from the Board. We would like to thank Martin, Alison and  Christopher for the extremely valuable  contribution they made to Cambian during   a time of significant transition. Following an independent Board review  undertaken by The People Stuff towards the  end of last year, we have decided to appoint  an additional non-executive director with  significant experience in children’s services. We  expect to make the appointment during 2018. One of our Key Performance  Indicators is to increase this percentage in   the medium term to over 85% and to have   no facilities rated as “Inadequate”. In addition following a review of the   Company’s capital requirements for the   next three years, on 30 January 2018 the  Board declared a further special dividend   of £15 million (8.2 pence per share). The Board intends to maintain a progressive  dividend policy . Our people Nothing of what we do to improve the lives  of the children placed in our care would  be achievable without the hard work  and dedication of the front-line staff and  managers throughout our organisation. Our focus is on those  with autism, learning difficulties, emotional  and social difficulties, mental health  needs, and those suffering as a result of  sexual abuse or exploitation. Christopher Kemball Chairman  20 March 2018 Financial results and position Revenue increased by 8% to £196.0 million  (2016: £182.1 million), after the inclusion of  £2.4 million TSA income, with 6% underlying  growth in revenue from operations, while  adjusted EBITDA was £18.7 million (2016:  £16.2 million). Adjusted earnings per  share were 3.6 pence (2016: 2.4 pence). The loss  for the year from discontinued operations  was £3.6 million (2016: £155.0 million  profit) and the total loss for the year was  £11.4 million (2016: £123.8 million profit). We ended the year with a strong balance  sheet. Notes: 1  Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before net finance costs, tax,  depreciation, amortisation, profit or loss on disposal of  assets, merger and acquisition (M&A) costs, IPO share  option charges and exceptional items. We see a number of drivers contributing  to increasing levels of demand in our  addressable market: population growth;  increasing underlying rates of incidence  of certain conditions; greater awareness  of needs; and improving diagnosis of  conditions and comorbidities. Independent providers can also offer benefits  for commissioners through greater levels  of specialisation.

These positives were offset  by one-off impacts resulting from the sale of  the Adult Services business and a provision  made for changes to legislation regarding  staff “sleep-ins” at our facilities. Operating profit before exceptional   items was £2.4 million (2016: £0.2 million  loss) with a statutory operating loss of   £8.8 million (2016: £7.6 million loss). The  loss from discontinued operations following  the sale of the Adult Services business was   £3.6 million (2016: £155.0 million profit). Average occupancy was broadly level  at 1,286 places (2016: 1,294) with an  underlying transition towards higher severity  cases during the year. Average utilisation  increased to 78% (2016: 74%) following a  planned reduction in operational capacity   to 1,643 (2016: 1,744). Average occupancy in the fostering division  was 634 (2016: 645) with 649 placements   at the end of the year.  Creating a strong Children’s   Services platform The completion of the TSA allowed us to  focus on reducing our central costs to align  our business with its new scale and focus  on Children’s Services with an efficient  overhead structure. We reduced our cost  base in the second half of the year and are  continuing to identify further operational  efficiencies that will be delivered during  2018 and 2019. During the period, I am pleased to report  that we have significantly strengthened  our management team to ensure we  are able to execute on our strategy. Our  key appointments include the following  experienced leaders: • Anoop Kang, formerly at Kier Group and  Balfour Beatty, joined us as CFO. • Rob Walker, previously at Mencap, joined  us as People Director. • Dr Sharon Menghini, formerly Director of  Children’s Services at a number of local
