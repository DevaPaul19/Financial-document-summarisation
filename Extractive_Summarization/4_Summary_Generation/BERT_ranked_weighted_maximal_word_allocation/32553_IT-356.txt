In January 2017, we completed our first  acquisition in 14 years, adding DuPont  Authentication to the De La Rue family. The banknote manufacturing footprint  restructuring programme is progressing  to plan. Adjusted basic earnings per share*  decreased by 2% due to the benefit of a  non-recurring tax benefit in the prior year.
