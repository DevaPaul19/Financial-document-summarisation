This includes the recommended offer made by Informa for   UBM plc in January 2018 that is currently progressing through  the necessary approval process: an exciting opportunity to create   a leading B2B information services group, with all the benefits   of operating scale and industry specialisation this brings. The participation and engagement of all colleagues across   the Group has been pivotal to GAP and the improving  performance, and everyone’s considerable contributions, are  appreciated and hopefully recognised in real time, at all levels. GROWTH ACCELERATION, GROWTH IMPROVEMENT The Growth Acceleration Plan was designed with a simple goal:  to progressively return every part of the Group to growth, while  simultaneously building the capabilities and platforms for future  scale and consistent performance. It was also built on the belief that the Knowledge and Information  market was expanding at pace, and, along with many of the  industry verticals in which our customers operate, offered the  potential for long-term growth. Group revenues stood at £1,758m, an increase of almost 31% at  a headline level, including the benefit of adding Penton Information  Services in late 2016, and 3.4% at an underlying level. It has been fantastic   to see the enthusiasm of our new Penton colleagues and their  eagerness to explore the opportunities available from being part  of a more international business. This is in spite of operating as a much larger   business, following the addition of brands from Penton   including exhibitions in the Health & Nutrition and Agriculture  verticals (Natural Products Expo, Farm Progress) and YPI,   the portfolio of US-based events in the international yachting  vertical acquired in March 2017 .
