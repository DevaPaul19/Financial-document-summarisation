Since signing the  partnership, we have implemented the  core foundations for a solid working  relationship and most importantly  recruited an international team to work  solely with TCC. This is particularly relevant for our  mid-tier customers who increasingly  want an end-to-end solution. A year of strategic and   operational progress The Board is delighted with the  significant strategic and operational  progress made during the year. This momentum gives visibility of  revenue for the first quarter for the  financial year ending 30 June 2018  to be at least 32% up on prior year  comparative period at approximately  £3.0m. Most importantly, there is an  expectation that a higher proportion  of revenue will be generated from  recurring subscriptions and transaction  revenue expected to be approximately  £2.2m, 73% (Q1 FY17: £1.6m, 71%). 71 % INCREASE IN REVENUE Looking further ahead, there is an  expectation that the percentage of  revenue from recurring subscriptions and  transactions will continue to improve as  our significant clients begin to transact  through the platform at scale and the  impact of new strategic partnerships  that drive increased transactions.
