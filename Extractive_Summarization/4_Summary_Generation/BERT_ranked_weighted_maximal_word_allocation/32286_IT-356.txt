I am writing this statement in the immediate aftermath of the  tragic event of the Grenfell Tower fire in which so many people  have sadly lost their lives. In this  statement, I wish to focus upon governance, people and strategy. Governance  Following my appointment as Chair in February 2015, the Board  concluded that bpha’s governance would benefit by working to  a greater extent through committees; this would facilitate greater  scrutiny outside of the formal Board meetings by specialist  Non-Executive and Independent Members who could bring  both constructive challenge and support to the Executive  whilst providing greater assurance to the Board. In addition to the appointment of Paul High, I was delighted to  welcome Jill Ainscough to the Board as Chair of the Remuneration  and Nominations Committee, replacing Neil. Ian will succeed  Peter Male and Peter will remain as Senior Independent Director.
