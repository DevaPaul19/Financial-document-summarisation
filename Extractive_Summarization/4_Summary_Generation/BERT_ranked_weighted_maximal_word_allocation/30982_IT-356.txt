Cash ﬂow and net debt The Group generated positive net cash ﬂows from operating activities of £3.0m (2016: £3.4m), driven by EBITDA and a positive working capital swing with a reduction in debtor days to 20 (2016: 29 days). LDI seeks to reduce volatility of the scheme deﬁcit by hedging against liability risks, which was considered to be appropriate given the maturity of the scheme (88% of members are pensioners). As a result, share capital reduced to £2.0m (2016: £16.3m) and a capital redemption reserve of £14.3m was created (2016: £nil). Details of the responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are set out in the remuneration report on pages 26 to 29. The committee has access to external advisors to assist it with ensuring that salary and beneﬁt packages are competitive and appropriate.
