N Brown Group plc   Annual Report & Accounts 2017 11 Strategic report A year of  encouraging  progress CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT “The transformative  changes we have  made over the past  few years have  started to deliver  results, as we benefit  from our new-found  trading agility.” I continue to be impressed by the sheer  quantum of change that has occurred  in the business over the past few years. Whilst the process of transformation  has not been without its challenges,  the business is now in a much stronger  position, with a far more sustainable  model for the future. In September we gained our full FCA  authorisation. This was an important  milestone for the Group and marked  the successful end to a lengthy and  thorough process. This coming year will be another  important one for the Group. 12 N Brown Group plc   Annual Report & Accounts 2017 BOARD DIVERSITY  Male Female 6 3 BOARD COMPOSITION  Non-Executive Directors 7 2 Executive Directors We continue to innovate and improve our  ways of working to ensure we continually  put the customer at the centre of  everything we 18 N Brown Group
