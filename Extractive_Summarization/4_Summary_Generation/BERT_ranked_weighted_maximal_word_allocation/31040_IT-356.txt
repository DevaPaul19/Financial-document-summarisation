Polypipe supplied a complete  prefabricated solution using Polystorm  geocellular tanks, together with pipework,  manholes and catchpits all manufactured  off-site. With our Nuaire business providing  energy efficient ventilation systems for  the residential, commercial and industrial  sectors in the UK, we have a diversity  of offering that further strengthens our  offer for Climate Management solutions.

OUTLOOK Following the Group’s record  performance in 2017, the current year  has started ahead of the same period  last year.
