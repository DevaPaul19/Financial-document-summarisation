Strategic Report / Chairman’s Statement SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 05 EARLIER OPTIMISM JUSTIFIED  In my report for 2016, I advised that, given the  strength of our then current order book and  short-term pipeline, we anticipated that the  growth we were seeing would continue into  at least the first half of 2017. This was, indeed, the case and I am pleased  to report that our optimism and guidance was  well placed. Going into 2018 the outlook continues to be  very encouraging. Further contract  wins across the Group in the last quarter of  2017 also meant that we entered 2018 with a  record order book of £91.3m. Operational cash flows were very healthy  across the year, resulting in further reductions  in net debt and underpinning a healthy 10%  uplift in the recommended final dividend  payment. With the acquisition of the ANNOVA  Systems GmbH (“Annova”) business our  income streams (which are predominantly in  £ sterling and €) are well balanced, providing  an internal hedge against exchange-rate  movements. In addition to winning the Heinrich Hertz  project, our Space division has extended  its footprint in the Galileo project while our  Enterprise Solutions and Defence (ESD)  division has seen key wins late in the year  with Public Health England, and the Forestry  Commission, as well as new work with a  major defence prime contractor. The SCISYS Group is a leading developer of IT solutions and services. OUR   PURPOSE OUR  VISION OUR VALUES OUR PRINCIPLES OUR  MISSION SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 06 We believe that SCISYS is well positioned in  the short to medium term and that our ESD  division might even gain from the situation. While we very much  welcome the UK government’s strong support  Strategic Report / Chief
