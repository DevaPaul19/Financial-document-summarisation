 2 EBITDA is calculated on a business performance basis, and is calculated by taking profit/(loss) from operations before tax and  finance income/(costs) and adding back depletion, depreciation, foreign exchange movements and the realised gain/(loss) on  foreign currency derivatives related to capital expenditure. The Group’s  performance since the last  Annual Report and current  outlook is covered within  the Chairman’s statement,  the Chief Executive’s   report and the Operating,   Financial and Corporate  responsibility reviews. SEE PAGES 08 to 11 and 18 to 28 F: Cash capex ($ million) 3 1 5 1 6 1 7 751.1 609.2 367.6 (39.7)% Cash capex was 39.7% lower than 2016,  primarily driven by lower spend at  Kraken, which came onstream in Q2  2017. FOR MORE DETAILS SEE PAGES 31 to 35 H: Net 2P reserves (MMboe) 1 5 1 6 1 7 203 215 210 (2.4)% The slight reduction in reserves reflects  the combined effects of the year’s  production and changes in long-term  assumptions, combined with lower  production performance in the North  Sea, partially offset by the Magnus  acquisition related increase and better  performance in Malaysia. The Group continued to pursue its vision  and advance its long-term growth plan,  agreeing and completing the acquisition  of interests in the Magnus oil field and the  Sullom Voe Oil Terminal (‘SVT’) from BP. I thank  Philip for his valuable contribution to the  Company, especially in its development  over the past five years. This year, it has been updated  with guidance on preventing the  facilitation of tax avoidance. Consequently, it is important that  we prioritise our resources to those key  projects which maximise cash flow to  facilitate debt reduction, continuing the  Company’s progress towards a more  sustainable balance sheet and enabling  the long-term growth of the business.
