As set out in more detail in the Chief Executive’s  Statement on pages 8 to 10 and the Financial Review  on pages 26 to 29, the Group has delivered a resilient  set of results with marginal growth in underlying  profit before tax and earnings per share. These results  are positive in the context of an uncertain political  and economic climate experienced in the year,  together with the changes within the automotive  industry, as many of our customers plan for an  increasingly electrified future. Following the acquisition of Exnovo early in the year  and Control Point Corporation after the year-end, I would like to welcome those  employees to Ricardo. I would also like to congratulate all those individuals  and team members who have won awards under the  various Ricardo recognition programmes during the  year, together with those members of staff who have  gained academic success or peer group recognition  in their chosen career paths. With a record order book and a good  pipeline of opportunities across all sectors, the Group  has the platform for future growth and to address  these challenges as an increasingly diverse, balanced  and global Automotive, Rail and Environmental  consulting business.
