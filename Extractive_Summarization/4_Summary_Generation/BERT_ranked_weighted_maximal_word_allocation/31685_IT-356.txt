 52 Notes to the Company Financial Statements  59 Five Year Statistical Record Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2 Chairman’s Statement Sir Michael Heller Turnover for the year to 30 September 2017  was £5.11 million compared with £4.96 million  the previous year, an increase of 3%. At the  half-year stage, we reported that sales activity  had improved modestly compared to the  previous year and that continued into the  second half in spite of a challenging market. Adjusted operating profit was £540,000,  compared with £430,000 last year, an  increase of 26%. This profit measure,  which excludes non-cash IFRS items and  exceptional non-trading costs, is reconciled  to statutory operating profit in note 4 to  the consolidated financial statements. As management exercised tight control  to maintain overheads at similar levels to  the previous year, the increase in sales had  a significant impact on operating profit. Last year’s result included one-off  property costs of £104,000 relating to a  property that we have now sold. Adjusting  for that item would result in an increase  in statutory pre-tax profit of 20%. Contracted recurring revenues, which  comprise annual software licence fees and  periodic hosting charges, remained strong  at 80% of total revenues (2016: 82%). Revenues delivered through our hosting  centre continued to increase and in the year  under review represented 61% of total  revenues (2016: 59%). R&D cash expenditure for the year was  £901,000 (2016: £982,000) and was  principally focussed on continued  enhancements to our key products,  Quantum VS and Vecta. As previously reported, we sold our remaining  surplus freehold property for £1.2 million in  December 2016. The property’s carrying value  had previously been adjusted to reflect the  expected net sale proceeds which, after  disposal costs, amounted to £1.17 million. The process that we started some years ago,  to dispose of six freehold properties which  had become surplus to operating requirements,  has generated more than £7 million of cash  which has supported distributions to  shareholders in excess of £11 million  over the same period. At the year end our cash balances were  £6.4 million compared with £5.4 million last  year. The increase reflects the proceeds  from the sale of property referred to above. Operating cash flows were £580,000  (2016: £818,000) and dividends paid  amounted to £635,000 (2016: £631,000). Net assets at 30 September 2017 were  £6.4 million compared to £3.2 million at  30 September 2016. This significant increase  is principally due to the elimination of the  deficit on the defined benefit pension scheme  under IAS 19. Net of deferred tax, the position  on the scheme has improved by £3.4 million  during the year due largely to improved
