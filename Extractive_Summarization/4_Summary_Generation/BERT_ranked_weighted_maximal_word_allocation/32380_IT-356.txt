 6  Ordinary dividends paid/proposed relating to the financial year “Our ﬁrst full year as a listed company has been one of progress as we have worked hard to position  the Group for future growth. Clearly regulatory change is likely to have some impact on the business, but we believe we are well  positioned to beneﬁt from market share gains in the medium to long term, with our ability to adapt  our leading proprietary technology and focus on client service and regulatory compliance supported  by our ﬁnancial strength.” We have made strong progress on each of  the strategic initiatives, greater detail of which is included later  in the annual report. Manjit Wolstenholme will be stepping down from the Board  at our Annual General Meeting on 27 July 2017. We have commenced  a thorough search for a successor. Our people On behalf of the Board I would like to thank all of our staff for  their hard work once again. We have a  considerable talent base in our London head office and intend  to maintain the UK as our global headquarters. Whilst the Group’s policy is to pay dividends of 50%  of underlying profit after tax, given the Group’s strong cash  position, the Board has decided to maintain the full year total  ordinary dividend in line with the prior year. Outlook 2018 will be an important year for the Group as the regulatory  changes are finalised and the way the Group will best serve the  needs of our clients within that environment becomes clear.
