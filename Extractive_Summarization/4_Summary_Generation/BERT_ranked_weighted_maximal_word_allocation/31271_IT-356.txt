 3 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN’S  STATEMENT Dear Shareholder I am delighted to report that Serica made strong  progress in 2017. We welcome Mitch and the team who have joined with  him. The acquisition of the BKR Assets provides for an  effective date of 1 January 2018. To-date we are making good progress with  all of these transition requirements, working closely with  BP, partners and the various regulatory bodies. Further information, as well as an update on Erskine  where production is currently suspended due to a  pipeline blockage, is provided in the Chief Executive’s  Report and the Operations and Financial Reviews but  the overall impact of the acquisition will be significant  to the Company and its future prospects. Underlying  reserves will have increased some sixteen-fold to  approximately 50 million boe as at 1 January 2018 and  the strength and depth of the Company will have been  transformed by combining the Company’s skills with  those of the BP employees joining us. Following completion of the transaction, Serica’s  production will be predominantly gas, with the Rhum  and Bruce fields alone accounting for up to 5% of total  UK gas production. 4 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Whilst there will undoubtedly be challenges ahead I  am very optimistic about the Company’s future and its  ability to consolidate our recent acquisition and build  on the platform that we have now created.
