 Our ambition is to be considered the best-managed  business in our sector. Our customers define what outcomes  or services they need to deliver, and we develop  new and more effective ways to deliver them. In this way we make a positive  difference to the lives of millions of people around   the world, and help keep nations safe.

I am proud of the work we do and of the continued  progress being made. Transformation then started in earnest, and will  continue through 2018 and 2019.

During the year, Ralph Crosby and Angie Risley stepped  down from the Board, both having joined Serco during  2011. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to both  Ralph and Angie Revenue  including that
