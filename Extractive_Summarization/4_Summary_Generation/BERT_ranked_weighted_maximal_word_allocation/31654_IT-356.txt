 easyHotel at a glance Growing our pipeline I am delighted to report that easyHotel  has made great progress in implementing  its strategy for growth. In addition, a number of initiatives have been  progressed during the year to optimise the value  of existing assets including investments to improve  our revenue management systems and processes  and our customers’ online booking experience. The equity capital and bank debt we raised  last year have enabled us to commit to a strong  pipeline of new sites. Following recent acquisitions  those funds are now substantially committed. During the year, two new owned  hotels have been opened in Birmingham and  Manchester and both are trading strongly. A programme to refresh two of three legacy owned  assets (Croydon and Glasgow) will be completed  within the coming months and we expect to see  a similar positive impact on the revenues of those  hotels. Dividend An interim dividend of 0.1 1p per ordinary share  was paid on 30 June 2017 . Chief Executive Officer, Guy Parsons,  and Chief Financial Officer, Marc Vieilledent,  bring a wealth of sector experience, hard  work and commitment that enable us to  make considerable progress. Outlook Whilst the wider macroeconomic uncertainty  continues to impact consumer confidence,  we believe easyHotel is well positioned.
