Your Board has also undergone some change during  the year and I’m delighted to have welcomed Richard  Cooper and Giles Vardey, who bring leading gaming  and business experience, and Andrew Gaughan, now  CEO, to the PLC Board. In March 2017 the Group announced a conditional  agreement to sell the Football Pools business, which  was subsequently passed by shareholders in April  2017. Following the  announced decisions by UK-based senior executives  to leave the now US-focused Group, a cost reduction  exercise commenced to streamline the UK cost base. However, the  Board, together with its advisors, concluded that none  of those approaches were likely to result in an offer  for all or a material part of the Group that the Board  would be able to recommend to shareholders, and the  termination of this process was therefore announced  on 14 March 2018. Strategic Review The Strategic Review, announced on 18 September  2017, concluded that Sportech has significant  potential for long-term value creation through  a combination of: growing its core businesses;  diversification; and benefitting from the possible  liberalisation of sports betting
