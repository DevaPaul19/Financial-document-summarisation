  CHAIRMANâ€™S STATEMENT I am pleased to introduce the 2017 Annual Report and  Financial Statements. During 2017, the Group has made very  promising progress in the development of its MEX-GOL, SV  and VAS gas and condensate fields in north-eastern Ukraine,  with significant improvements in production rates, leading to   a much improved financial performance. In addition, the VAS field has continued to  produce consistently during the year. This compares with an  aggregate production rate of approximately 1,700 boepd at  the end of 2016, which represents an increase of nearly 65%  over the year. The deregulation of the gas supply market, supported  by electronic gas trading platforms and improved pricing  transparency, has meant that the market gas prices in Ukraine  now broadly correlate with the imported gas prices. During  2017, gas prices were reasonably stable, allowing for some  seasonal variation, and were higher than in 2016. Later in August 2017, Bruce Burrows joined  the Board as Non-Executive Director, and Adrian Coates  stepped down from the Board at the same time. On behalf of the Board,   I would like to thank each of Keith, Alastair and Adrian for  their valued contributions during their respective tenures with  the Company. Outlook While there are still challenges in the business environment in  Ukraine, the situation is improving and the Group is continuing  to progress the development of its Ukrainian fields. After the  operational successes of 2017 and the increased production  output during the year, we are looking forward to achieving  further successes in the development activities planned for  2018 and delivering a steadily increasing production and  revenue stream in the future.
