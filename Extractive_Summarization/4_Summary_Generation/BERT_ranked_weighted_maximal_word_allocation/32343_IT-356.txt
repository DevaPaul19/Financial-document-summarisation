 02 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements We will continue to build the  foundations for future dividend  progression. This need has already risen substantially  and will grow further in the years  to come. Our signiﬁcant and increasing  investment in distribution is delivering  excellent returns, sustainable income  growth and long term value for our  shareholders. Conversely, physical retail  continues to face signiﬁcant challenges  from this online shift with the inevitable  space overcapacity this brings to the  retail market. Our sector leading portfolio  metrics have been maintained thanks  to our strong occupier and property  relationships. Over the last four years,  through management activity, our  occupancy level has been above  99% and our unexpired lease term has  remained at 12.8 years with only 1% of  our leases due to expire within the next  three years. An attractive dividend needs to  be adequately covered by operating  earnings and I’m pleased that we have  maintained the 1.1x dividend cover we  achieved last year. We will continue to build the  foundations for future dividend  progression. LondonMetric is well placed and I  am genuinely excited by its outlook  and look forward to the year  with conﬁdence. 03 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 At a glance Our strategic 12 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements We continue to maintain our very
