Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA Customer: Praxis Project Title: Aurora Annual Report 2017 T: 0207 055 6500 F: 020 7055 6600 Performance Review The performance for the year to end December 2017 was +18.5%, out-performing the  benchmark FTSE All Share Index by 5.4%. This fee is subject to claw back and a high water mark and is capped  at 4% of NAV p.a. The NAV had lagged the Index in 2016 and, as the  performance fee is calculated on a cumulative basis, it can only be earned once the  lag has been caught-up. The share price of Aurora traded at a premium to NAV for substantially all of the  period in question. Accordingly our aim is for the shares to continue to trade at a small  premium to NAV and to grow the Company further, as discussed below. Two Years of Phoenix Management 2017 was the second full year of Phoenix management, which began with their being  appointed Investment Manager in January 2016. Aurora is managed under the same  investment strategy as Phoenix’s long standing, open-ended fund, the Phoenix UK  Fund. Since its inception in 1998 that fund has delivered, net of fees, annualised  returns of 10% compared with 5.5% for the FTSE All-Share Index. There’s a lot of  talk about patient capital but it seems to me that the root of long term outperformance  is the willingness to accept some periods of underperformance followed by (hopefully  more significant) periods of outperformance based on core investment principles. The key though are those investment principles that guide the stock selection. Phoenix build up the required knowledge by studying the  relevant industries and companies in detail – a learning process which can take several  years. When it comes to price, Phoenix are disciplined in only paying up to half of what  they believe the business is worth. In the case of Phoenix this involves knowing  some sectors really very well. That requires that patience and discipline but it also  requires a willingness to shut out other ideas and stay focused on what you know –  your circle of competence. Alternatively, it could mean a focus on housebuilding companies  or, indeed, specialist hobby brands – a niche within the consumer space arguably –  which involves outfits such as Hornby or latterly Stanley Gibbons. This  means turnover can and has been low. The Existing Investment Policy limits the scope of  investment to UK listed equities and cash. From the Board’s discussions with Phoenix, it is clear that the proposed amendments  do not represent a shift in Phoenix’s investment strategy and objectives. Rather, they  will enable Phoenix to implement more effectively their well-established investment  philosophy. The ability to hold 10% of gross assets at cost price, in unlisted securities  is also necessary to participate in the Stanley Gibbons investment, which Phoenix  have recently undertaken. Growth of the Company  Growing the Company remains a key objective of the Board. A new prospectus was  published during the year to enable the continued issuance of new shares, both via  small “tap-issues” and larger, more structured “Placings” . A total of 12,679,198 new  shares were issued in 2017 , bringing the total number of shares issued during the era  of Phoenix management to 28,080,114. Frostrow has an excellent reputation built on the provision of similar  services to a select number of other investment trusts. In last year’s statement I mentioned our objective was to increase the size of  Aurora to £100m. At the time of writing, the market cap has reached £92.63m and it  seems appropriate to update the objective. As well as  finding sufficient opportunities to invest new money, it is essential that the Company  attracts new shareholders with a long-term focus who understand and respect the  Phoenix investment strategy. AGM A warm welcome is extended to shareholders to the AGM to be held at 12 noon on  6 June 2018 at the offices of Grant Thornton, 30 Finsbury Square, London EC2P 2YU.
