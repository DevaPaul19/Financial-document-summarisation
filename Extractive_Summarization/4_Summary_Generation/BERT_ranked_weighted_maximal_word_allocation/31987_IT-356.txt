As previously announced, we encountered a specific  sample preparation problem relating to a supplier  component in the MTB/RIF test. As  stated in the trading statement of 13 July 2017, no additional  short term revenues were expected from MTB/RIF in India. Away from our core human healthcare focus, we enjoyed  success with funded field trials of Genedrive® for white-spot  disease detection in farmed shrimp. The Company however  remains focused on the human health market and will only  pursue this opportunity further if a commercial partner can  be identified. Revenues and operating margin  were up on the same period last year. Governance and People Strong governance and values are vitally important to the  success of the Company and the Board remains focused on  ensuring its own effectiveness and that of the governance  processes throughout the Company. The Board has recently  gone through some changes. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our staff and  extend this thanks to our investors and customers for their  commitment and support. We look forward to updating  investors during the year on further progress and delivery  6 CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW
