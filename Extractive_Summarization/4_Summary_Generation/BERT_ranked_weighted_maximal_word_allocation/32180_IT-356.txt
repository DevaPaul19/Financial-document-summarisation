Our ability  to deliver forward sold homes to our customers  on programme, together with a step change in our  presence in the build to rent sector, saw Telford  Homes achieving excellent results for the year to  31 March 2017. Therefore, the interim dividend  together with the full year dividend equates to  over 40 per cent of earnings for this financial year. The final dividend will be paid on 14 July 2017 to  those shareholders on the register at the close of  business on 16 June 2017. For this reason, the Group plans  to review its corporate vision, mission and values  during 2017 to ensure these reflect the evolving  position of the business and allow us to capitalise   on the opportunities that lie ahead. Andrew Wiseman Chairman 30 May 2017 THE  PAVILIONS N1 'I am delighted to be able to look back on another  excellent year, and, on behalf of the Board, I wish  to thank all of our employees for their hard work  in delivering these results.' This has  led to ever growing demand for housing in the  capital which has not been matched by the  number of homes built. The immediate impact of the EU referendum in  June 2016 was relatively short-lived, with the  widespread positive attitude adopted within  the UK maintaining consumer and business  confidence. With prices high in  central boroughs,  the search for value  and for higher price  growth prospects in  recent years has led  to a surge in demand  in Outer London  locations.
