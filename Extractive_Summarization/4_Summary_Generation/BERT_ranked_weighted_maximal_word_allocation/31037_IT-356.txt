 49 Company information    Symphony is a world leader in controlled-life  plastic, and supplies masterbatches and finished  plastic products. Plastic waste is a global problem which is now  dominating the media and concentrating the  minds of legislators, companies, NGOs and  scientists around the world. This is really significant, as  one third of the food produced each year   is wasted. d 2 w is fully consistent with the principles of  “Reduce”, “Re-use” and “Recycle”. It is also the  best technology available for our customers,   for consumers and for the protection of   the environment. Symphony has also developed a range of plastic  technologies under the d 2 p (designed to protect)  brand, offering extra protection from bacteria,  insects, fungi, algae, odour, fouling, and fire. Our products are marketed through a network   of distributors in nearly 100 countries worldwide. Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  |  www.symphonyenvironmental.com 04 DELIVERING  TECHNOLOGY   & PRODUCTS  I am very pleased to report a 249.6%  increase in profit before tax to  £430,000 (2016: £123,000) together  with £1.03 million cash generated from  operations (2016: cash consumed  £0.34 million). Symphony laboratory Our d 2 w oxo-biodegradable plastic technology fits in  perfectly with many governments’ core principles of the  3 Rs, “reduce, re-use, recycle”. However, unlike ordinary  plastics, a plastic upgraded with d 2 w technology does  not cause the accumulation of microplastics in the  environment, as it converts much more rapidly into  biodegradable materials. Our strategy, as  previously reported, was to expand the product range  with synergistic technologies which can be offered to  the same customer base, and I am pleased to report  that this is progressing well. Revenues for the year increased by 21.6% to £8.27  million (2016: £6.80 million), with gross Symphony Environmental Technologies plc
