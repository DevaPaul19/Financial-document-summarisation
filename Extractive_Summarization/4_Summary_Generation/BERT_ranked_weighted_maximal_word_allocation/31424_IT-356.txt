  Chairman’s statement Effective risk management Improved pricing for insurance in 2018 should  improve the prospects for underwriting profits Lower capacity  auction prices in  2017 will allow more  effective use of  available Helios funds. Michael Cunningham Non-executive Chairman Summary • Loss before tax and impairment of  £406,000 (2016 profit: £1,336,000) • Adjusted net asset value at  £1.60 per share (2016: £1.96)  • Five acquisitions in 2017 added  £4.4m of capacity to 2017  underwriting year – 13% increase • 1.5p per share total dividend  payable (2016: 5.5p) Your Board announces the results for 2017  which were affected by the underwriting losses  arising from natural catastrophes that occurred  in 2017 and by the reduction in the value of  the syndicate portfolio of capacity. During 2017 the key  developments were: • building the portfolio of capacity to £41m  for 2018 by acquiring a further five limited  liability vehicles (“LLVs”); • maintaining the quality of the portfolio  and the outperformance of the underwriting  results average against the Lloyd’s market  as a whole; • continuing to use quota share reinsurance  to reduce the risk from the underwriting  and to assist in the financing of the  underwriting capital of the portfolio; and • broadening the access to the portfolio  to private capital by using a protected  cell reinsurance structure. This dividend will be payable to shareholders  on the register on 8 June 2018. The board has considered the  existing dividend policy which would in normal  circumstances have paid a special dividend  between 20-30% of the 2015 underwriting year  profits received. The strategy of building a capacity  portfolio of the better available syndicates  at Lloyd’s should allow Helios to maintain  its outperformance of returns on capacity  against the Lloyd’s market.
