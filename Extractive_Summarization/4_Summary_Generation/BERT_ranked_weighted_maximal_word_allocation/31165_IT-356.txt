 10 Empresaria Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Chairman’s statement The Group has delivered  another record year of profit. As well as the growth in profit, our  diversification across sectors and geographies  helps to reduce risk and insulate the Group  from difficulties in individual markets. Empresaria is a global business, operating  from locations in 20 countries. The Board sees good  opportunities for growth across the Group  and we will continue to invest in our brands  to build capacity and coverage. Against this is ongoing geo-political  uncertainty, which could derail growth in  any territory, as well as the impact of new  legislation in our markets, with particular  changes in Germany and Japan impacting  the temporary staffing markets in 2018. People, values & culture The Board has over 100 years of combined  experience in the staffing industry and  during the year we took steps to strengthen  the board with Spencer Wreford taking  on the role of Chief Operating Officer. The success of the  Group is down to the hard work of every  one of them and the Board would like to  thank each individual for their contribution  to our success. It is important for businesses to have a clear  vision to help frame all decision making and  identify priorities for investment. We believe in a strong and clear  governance approach and expect high  standards and compliance across the  Group. Our culture is based on shared  ownership and reward. The adjusted measures  exclude amortisation, exceptional items,  profit or loss on business disposals and  fair value charges on equity instruments. 4 8 12 2 6 10 2015 2016 2013 2014 2017 Adjusted profit before tax (£m) Adjusted profit before tax (£m) Profit before tax 5.4 6.1 7.5 9.2 11.0 4.9 5.9 7.1 7.9 8.1 Strategic report Governance Financials 11 Highlights of 2017 Strengthening   a
