Dear Shareholder I write to you at the end of a year in which research-  based pharmaceutical companies faced a tough  marketplace and operating environment. Performance for the year reflected strong  double digit sales growth for Crestor, Seroquel XR and Symbicort. It was also impacted by government pricing interventions and generic  competition, which combined to reduce revenue by some $3 billion. Reported earnings per share for the full year were up 29% at   $7.33 (2010: $5.60), which also included the non-taxable gain   of $1.08 from the Astra Tech sale. Thirdly, there remains  considerable unmet medical need. Chronic diseases are on the  increase, not only in wealthy countries but also in middle income and,  increasingly, lower income countries. For example, some 346 million  people around the world have diabetes while 24 million are affected   by Alzheimer’s Disease. Finally, advances in science and technology  promise the continued delivery of new medicines that can make a real  difference to patient health. Yet, while the fundamentals remain strong, the challenges facing the  industry have been unprecedented in recent years. This includes pricing interventions in many countries. The regulatory  landscape is changing, becoming more global and more complex. It is no longer enough for new medicines to be safe and effective. Health authorities increasingly require additional information regarding  a medicine’s comparative clinical and cost effectiveness. Our strategic response It was with these challenges in mind that your Board undertook its  strategy review process in 2011. We believe there continue to be opportunities to create   value for those who invest in pharmaceutical innovation, and that  AstraZeneca has the skills and capabilities to take advantage of these  opportunities and turn them into long-term value through the research,  development and marketing of our medicines. Our 2011 review highlighted the ongoing need for a substantial  improvement in R&D productivity if we are to sustain acceptable  returns to shareholders. We also plan to reshape our other R&D global functions to better  support a more focused portfolio and create a simpler organisation  with greater flexibility in all functional areas. In his Chief Executive Officer’s Review on the following pages, David  Brennan outlines the steps we took in 2011 to secure our future  business success. David also emphasises that how we do business  is as important as what we
