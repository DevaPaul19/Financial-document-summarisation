Group revenue  is up 15% (9% at constant currencies) and  profit before taxation and highlighted  items after incurring the development  costs for new digital content products  is £12.0 million (2016: £13.0 million),  above market expectations. The Board  is recommending a final dividend of 5.6  pence per share to shareholders on the  register on 25 August 2017. This represents an increase in full year  dividend of 5% and continues Bloomsbury’s dividend growth each  year for over 20 years. Early in 2016, we simplified the organisational structure.

As explained in the 2016 Annual Report, the Board concluded that  it can best support the business as it evolves through a programme  of regular new Board appointments, while keeping the size of the  Board fixed at eight Directors. Accordingly, I am  pleased to welcome Steven Hall who joined the Board in March 2017  as a Non-Executive Director and member of the Audit Committee  and Nomination Committee.
