WHAT WE DO Our 20MW ‘FlexGen’ sites – which can  generate power within 30 seconds of  being switched on remotely – provide  a vital, low cost solution to assist in  balancing the UK’s energy supply on a  moment by moment basis.  Since the introduction of intermittent,  renewable power to the UK’s energy  mix as legacy carbon intensive capacity  is retired, the National Grid has faced  increasing risks of brownouts and  blackouts. UK power prices have seen  recent peaks above £1,500 per MW  hour due to outage and generation  imbalances; there is therefore a need  for a reliable source of power that can  be accessed quickly and flexibly during  periods when demand exceeds available  supply.  HOW WE OPERATE Our facilities use established, reliable  technology based on containerised  generators, fired with renewable green  fuel or gas – either mains or Liquidified  Natural Gas (LNG). Nine green fuel projects have been  financed with a combination of debt and  £35m of equity by Rockpool Investments  LLP in individual companies established  for this purpose. Plutus PowerGen has a  required by the solar farms,  and would therefore allow  greater utilisation of the  connections. By providing  an additional return to the  solar farm operators, we  would help to accelerate  the development of solar  farms without the need for  subsidy. Battery Sites These will generally be  stand-alone but may be  used in conjunction with  Gas or SolarFlex and  our stand-alone battery  projects are currently being  developed in partnership  with LDT. OUR PIPELINE We have a total pipeline of over 700MW, and will have 120MW of capacity in operation for this  winter with a further 140MW at the post-planning stage by the end of 2017. We aim to develop the following types of projects, and are actively working with a company  to explore ‘front-ending’ each site using exhaustible (i.e. non-firm) power from batteries or  capacitors to allow us to compete in additional balancing markets as well as be more price  competitive in existing markets: Green Fuel 100mw Green Fuel 60mw Gas 80mw Gas 700mw Green Fuel 20mw OPERATIONAL COMMISSIONED BY  YEAR END 2017 PERMITTED IN PLANNING   FOR NEXT CM PIPELINE 03 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Investment Proposition FAVOURABLE  MARKET DRIVERS   On-going structural changes in UK energy supply  continue to drive demand for flexible power generation  as the proportion of energy generated from intermittent  renewable sources continues to grow.
