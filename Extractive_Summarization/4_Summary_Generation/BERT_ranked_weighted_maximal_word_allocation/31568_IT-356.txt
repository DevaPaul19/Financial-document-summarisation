 The significant sales  momentum we have seen this year and the 609 software deals  we have signed - more than 3 times the number signed in the  prior year - underscores our confidence in our product and the  market’s readiness to engage in the potential of RPA. Our opportunity for geographic expansion  continues to broaden; our sales partners are highly engaged  and effective, continuing to deliver long term, valuable  customers; and we are investing in educating developers,  partners and customers on the power of RPA and the required  skills to take advantage of it. The Group has had a strong start to the first quarter of FY2018   and as such now expect revenues for the full financial year to be  comfortably ahead of existing market expectations. Alastair Bathgate Chief Executive Officer Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT OVERVIEW Since the flotation of Blue Prism in March 2016 we have  seen significant progress in the RPA market and in our  business. There have been advances in the size and visibility   of the RPA market and it is clear that RPA as a  technology offering is now high on the agenda for   many organisations. In the period, we have seen   a significant increase in sales, a substantial growth of our  customer base and further strengthening of our market- leading position whilst managing the cost   base and cash flow with real discipline. THE BOARD The Board, which was formed just prior to flotation,   is functioning well and interacting effectively with the  executive management contributing a good balance of  skills and experience. In particular, ensuring the  ongoing recruitment of senior experienced staff with  strong track records who can proactively engage in the  challenge of building a world-class technology Company. We  thank them for another year of hard work and  execution. OUTLOOK In the CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW Upsells
