 2 | Annual report and accounts 2017 Chairman’s statement Bob Ivell Chairman Overview In a challenging year characterised by  both political and economic turbulence,  I am pleased to report that the Group  made good progress in implementing  the programme of strategic initiatives to  extend the appeal of the Carpetright brand  and to address the significant legacy  issues within its property estate. The strategic update on pages  6 to 16 provides more details on our  progress against our plan. Underlying profit  before tax decreased by 21.3% to £14.4m  (2016: £18.3m). The Board The composition of the Board was  unchanged in the year. I am delighted that a significant number  of our colleagues now participate in our  SAYE share schemes, enabling them to  share in our future success. Delivering  a turnaround in these conditions is not  easy, but we continue to believe that the  strategic plan we are implementing will  ensure the business better capitalises  on its market leading position and  provides resilience against weaker  trading conditions. While we cannot control external market  conditions, we have a wide-ranging  programme of self-help measures on  which to concentrate and we believe these  have significant potential to improve the  performance of the Group.
