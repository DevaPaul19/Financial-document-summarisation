CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT BUSINESS PROFILE AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS I am pleased to report that Booker  Group has delivered another good  performance. In the 52 weeks to 24  March 2017 sales rose by 6.7% to £5.3bn  and operating profi t rose to £176.1m.  Customer satisfaction was strong. Our like-for-like sales to  caterers were up by 4.4%. The plans to ‘Broaden’ the business  are going well. On 14 September 2015, Budgens and  Londis joined the Group. Given the strong operational  performance and cash fl ow of the  business the Board recommends the  payment of a fi nal dividend of 4.97  pence per share (2016: 4.03 pence per  share) which, together with the interim  dividend, makes a total dividend for the  year of 5.60 pence per share (2016: 4.60  pence per share). The fi nal dividend is  payable on 7 July 2017 to shareholders  on the register on 9 June 2017. I should like to thank all our colleagues  for their contribution to the success of  the Group in the year just ended. On 27 January we announced the  planned merger with Tesco to form  the UK’s leading food business. It should also  help the Booker catering, retail and  small business customer prosper in a  challenging market. As a result of the proposed merger,  we  are in an offer period as defi ned in the  Takeover Code. We will not be making  forward looking statements for the  duration of the offer period. Annual General Meeting Our Annual General Meeting will be held  on 5 July 2017.
