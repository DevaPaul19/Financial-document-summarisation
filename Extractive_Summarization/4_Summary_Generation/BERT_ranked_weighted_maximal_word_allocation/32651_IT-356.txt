 Accelerated opening costs are defined by the Group  as the overhead investment in people, processes,  systems and new store pre-opening costs i.e. costs  directly associated with our accelerated store opening  programme. EBITDA is defined by the Group as profit/loss before tax,  exceptional items, depreciation, amortisation, profit/ (loss) on disposal of assets, net finance costs and shared  based payment charge attributable to the LTIP Growth  Share Scheme. *** As noted  in our Interim Results, during our period of rapid  growth, the number of proposition changes we asked  customers to embrace and a combination of the well  documented external factors caused a significant  drop in the trading momentum of the core business  from the end of H1 and start of H2. This converted to  an Adjusted EBITDA of £1.3m (2016: £2.6m) as lower  sales and subsequent margin investment temporarily  reduced the EBITDA generation of the legacy business. Whilst we remain  completely committed to the high street, shopping  centre and market location stores, the factory shop  concept is proving to deliver significantly better  financial returns with its higher sales, lower operating  costs (no hot food-to-go offer) and lower fit out costs. This feedback was positioned at the heart of  our sales recovery programme and helped shape  the refinements we set about achieving to provide  our managers with the necessary ‘freedom within a  framework’ plan to win back their local customers. With our production and distribution capability now  set up to service up to c.100 stores, we continue to  develop our award-winning quality homemade  produce and broaden the range of burgers, sausages,  meatballs, kebabs, grill sticks and mince in time for the  spring/summer. • Increased the number and depth of value-led   Most of the KPIs identified below are discussed in more detail in the Chairman’s Statement.
