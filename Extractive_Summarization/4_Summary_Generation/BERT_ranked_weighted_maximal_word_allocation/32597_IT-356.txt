When writing this statement last year,   our revenue growth expectation for the  year ahead was 37%, and the 58% growth  we actually achieved reflects the huge  effort made by our staff right across the  business, from the Board of Directors  and senior management, through to our  customer service and warehouse teams. This  translates into net profit of £2.3m   and earnings per share of 11.5 pence. To ensure we remain positioned for  further growth, the Group requires  additional head office capacity, and   the Board is delighted to announce a  property acquisition that provides an  excellent long-term solution to our  growth needs in our home city of York.
