The current momentum  and exciting trajectory of both compounds  offer potential investors an investable  proposition and an attractive offering   to joint venture partners. • A particularly noteworthy achievement by  the Company in the reporting period was  the successful completion of the VAL401  Phase ll clinical study in patients with late  stage non-small cell lung cancer, the most  common form of lung cancer. • This gives  the trial increased flexibility and speed for  reaching therapeutic levels and to reduce  disease progression. • The integration of our clinical in-house  team with a board of oncologists and  clinical nurse specialists has been providing  valuable insight into how we can more  rapidly bring safe, efficacious, therapeutic  and palliative medicines to cancer patients  to meet hitherto unmet needs in rapidly  growing markets. • The Company has also progressed the pre- clinical pipeline. The programmes currently  consist of VAL301, which is derived from the  formulation of VAL201 and the compound  VAL101, which is derived from our GeneICE  technology platform. The Company is very  much looking forward to taking the next  generation of therapeutics into further  development and through to the clinic. • VAL401 and VAL201 have received several  major patent grants and the IP portfolio  now covers all major areas worldwide.
