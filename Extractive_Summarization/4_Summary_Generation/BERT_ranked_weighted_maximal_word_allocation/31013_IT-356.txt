LESLIE VAN DE WALLE CHAIRMAN STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 5 OPERATING PROFIT  INCREASED BY 60% PROFIT BEFORE T AXATION   INCREASED BY 44% COUNTRIES  DELIVERING RECORD  PERFORMANCES 15 9.3p   FINAL DIVIDEND 3,793   HEADCOUNT 42.9p   BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE £31.1m   NET CASH *Constant currency is calculated by applying prior  year exchange rates to local currency results for  the current and prior years. All of the Group’s regions delivered  increases in both gross profit (net fee   income) and operating profit and 71%   (2016: 69%) of the Group’s net fee  income is now derived from overseas  businesses. Operating profit was up 60% (54%*) to  £41.9m (2016: £26.2m) and earnings per  share increased by 55% to 42.9p per share  (2016: 27.7p per share). The Group further strengthened its balance  sheet with net cash of £31. 1m as at 31  December 2017 (31 December 2016:  £22.5m). During the year, headcount increased by  17% to 3,793 (2016: 3,229). Headcount  investment is highest in those regions and  business units demonstrating the strongest  potential for accelerated growth. The Board will be recommending a 50%  increase in the final dividend to 9.3p per share   which combined with the interim dividend  of 2.75p per share would result in a 42%  increase in the total dividend to 12.05p   per share (2016: 8.5p). In 2017, the Group purchased 2.1m shares  at an average price of £3.79 for £8.0m, which   were subsequently cancelled. The Board is  authorised to re-purchase up to 10% of  the Group’s issued share capital and will  be seeking approval for the renewal of this  authority at the Annual General Meeting   on 17 May 2018. As recently announced, I will be stepping  down from my role as the Group’s Non- Executive Chairman on 1 March. It has been   a privilege to serve on the Board for the past   five years and I have absolutely no doubt that   the Robert Walters Group will continue to go   from strength to strength.
