They have acted with impressive decisiveness  in embedding a number of changes in our  operating teams to raise the talent bar across  our business. We have also made good progress in  developing and implementing the new  Horizon strategy to reposition our Group  for long‑term sustainable growth. In November, we announced the disposal of  our underperforming wire business, Oxford  Superconducting Technology, and since the  year end, we have announced the agreed sale  of our Industrial Analysis business to Hitachi  High‑Technologies. Chairman’s Statement As Ian Barkshire sets out in his Chief  Executive’s Review, the management  team is now implementing the next phase  of the Horizon strategy to continue the  transformation of Oxford Instruments.
