 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 04 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Executive Chairman’s statement  continued Our Business Model – strong and established  technology franchises As the Linux market and Open Source business have unique characteristics,  we have a dedicated focus on the SUSE Product Portfolio. In 2017 we continued to increase the headcount dedicated to development,  customer care and sales and marketing of the SUSE Portfolio and made the  ﬁrst acquisitions in this product portfolio. Portfolio management New Models Products or consumption models (cloud and subscription) that open new  opportunities could become growth drivers or represent emerging use  cases that we need to be able to embrace. This is the case where new innovation is needed to connect or leverage  existing IT or application assets to deliver returns or open new opportunities. In SUSE our investments in  OpenStack Cloud Infrastructure and Software-deﬁned Distributed Storage  are also clear examples. Security is a  major focus area for customers as they seek to balance being open and  accessible to their customers with the need to protect conﬁdential data  and intellectual property. Our business model  means the way we manage the portfolio is analogous to a “fund of funds” with  the objective of generating moderate growth over the medium-term, delivering  high levels of proﬁtability and strong cash generation and cash conversion ratio  with a balanced portfolio approach. We will continue to focus investment in  growth and core products and will not dispose of declining products unless  we can achieve greater than the discounted cash ﬂow they would generate  in our ownership. A shareholder who invested at  the time of the IPO and had reinvested the Returns of Value would have grown  their investment by 2,167% which is a compound annual return of 29.3%. Our net debt at 30 April 2017 was $1,410.6m and represents a multiple of  2.1 times Facility EBITDA of $673.4m, against our target of 2.5 times. Executive Management received the same percentage.

Signiﬁcant transactions such as Serena in FY17; or  3. Since the Completion of the TAG acquisition, the Company continues to  receive signiﬁcant numbers of approaches from owners of companies who  would be interested in becoming part of the larger Group. The bonus for executive directors and  operating committee members is maximized on achieving 10% growth over  the prior year CCY Underlying Adjusted EBITDA with a straight line between  the two points and for other staff there is no maximum. In year acquisitions are not included for bonus purposes. As at 30 April 2017 ASGs are outstanding over only 3,262,420 ordinary  shares granted to seven senior managers representing 1.4% of the voting  rights of the Company at 30 April 2017. As we look to the consolidation of the market the Company will be at a  disadvantage to US listed companies and private equity ﬁrms when negotiating  acquisitions if it is not free to negotiate appropriate management compensation. Key performance indicators to check that we are on track are Underlying  Adjusted EBITDA (absolute amount and growth percentage), cash conversion  (absolute amount and conversion percentage), free cash ﬂow and earnings  per share. The TAG and HPE Software transactions are transformational in terms of  the size of the Group from an operating point of view. The dividend will be paid in Sterling equivalent to 45.22 pence per share,  based on an exchange rate of £1 = $1.29, the rate applicable on 1 1 July 2017,  the date on which the board resolved to pay the dividend. Board changes and succession planning At the Completion of the HPE Software transaction the board has announced  that Chris Hsu will become CEO and Stephen Murdoch will become Chief  Operating Ofﬁcer (“COO”). To ensure delivery of the integration the board has agreed that I will remain  Executive Chairman until the announcement of the ﬁrst full year results after  Completion. This is currently expected to be January 2019. The board has determined  that Mr Schultz will not be independent. We would like to thank him for his contributions as a board member  and his continued commitment to Micro Focus as COO. Outlook Following completion of the acquisition of HPE Software, the Group intends to  align its ﬁnancial year end to 31 October and will report an 18 month ﬁnancial  period ending 31 October 2018. Consequently, in order to provide a meaningful comparison in  the pro-forma results for the year ended 30 April 2017 the  directors have combined the unaudited ﬁnancials for Serena  for the year ended 31 January 2016 with the audited ﬁgures  for Base Micro Focus for the year ended 30 April 2016. These  are the reporting segments and the cash generating units  for the Group. 51 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Executive Chairman’s introduction  Non-executive directors
