Since then, I have been impressed by how much the  Company has achieved in a few months in running the day-to-day  business, making significant progress on both the Karish and  Tanin project and the Prinos Basin expansion, and, most recently,  becoming a Premium Listed Company on the London Stock  Exchange (‘LSE’) in March 2018, the first significant European oil  and gas E&P listing since 2014 and the largest ever primary raise  for a Premium-Listed E&P company on the LSE. OurBoardandgovernance Our Board was chosen to ensure that, as a fast-growing public  Company, Energean demonstrates best practice governance  standards and provides sound stewardship. We are fortunate to have deep sector, financial, HSE and  capital markets expertise on the Board to guide the Company  going forward. I am very grateful to them all for everything   they have done. Dividendpolicy We are in a growth phase and our investors have bought into  an ambitious, fast-moving Company in an exciting region. We  therefore do not anticipate that the Company will pay a dividend  until the Karish and Tanin development is completed. The Board will review how it provides returns to  shareholders regularly
