As predicted since the UK Spring Budget, our Gibraltar operation  has seen almost no new business with regards to ROPS, whilst  Malta is now only receiving new business from the EEA. Conversely, our UK SIPP business has become the focus of new  business growth. This provides a steady  and highly visible annuity income stream. These are expected to continue at similar levels  going forward having generated revenue of £1.2 million in the  year (2016: £1.1 million). Group revenue for 2017 amounted to £21.5 million (2016: £17.4  million), and as anticipated EBITDA (Earnings before interest,  taxation, depreciation and amortisation) has increased by 55%  from £3.1 million in 2016 to £4.8 million in 2017. This is £0.5  million in 2017 (2016: £0.3 million). Profit before tax was £4.0 million for the year being a pleasing uplift  of 43% above the 2016 PBT result of £2.8 million notwithstanding  one-off costs and the technical reserve release referred to above. Whilst the corporate rate on Malta profits is  35%, the refund is 30% on tax due on dividends. During the year the Group also made the final deferred  consideration payment on the LCH acquisition
