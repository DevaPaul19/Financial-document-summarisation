During the year the core EDC (Electronic Document Capture) Division continued to bene- fit from its position as the leading global partner for EDC products and services with a significant level of new contract gains. In the face of very challenging global IT market condi- tions EDC continued its growth record and expanded its market position by new product launches and additional partnership agreements. The SGA (Samsung General Agency) Division experienced declining turnover rates in difficult trading conditions, but maintained an acceptable, albeit lower, level of operating profit contribution.

The Group spent £1.7m in cash on acquisitions and other investments during the year . OPERATING REVIEW The EDC Division is DICOM Group’s largest division, representing 82% of profits.
