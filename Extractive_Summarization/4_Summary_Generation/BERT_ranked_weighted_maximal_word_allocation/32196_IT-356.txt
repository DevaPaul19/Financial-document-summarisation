Wincanton plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 1 Strategic report Governance Directors’ remuneration report Directors’ report Independent auditor’s report Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT Making good  progress Steve Marshall  Chairman Strong positive cash  generation enables us  to lift our final dividend Wincanton plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2 STRATEGIC REPORT CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW OUTLOOK The Group remains well positioned in its  chosen markets and continues to perform  robustly and deliver strong service levels for  customers. To date the Group has experienced  no significant impact from the Brexit vote  in June 2016, and we believe the Group can  adequately manage any future uncertainty  that arises during the Brexit process. During the coming year the Board expect  Wincanton to make continued progress. Steve Marshall Chairman DIVIDEND  The Board are pleased to be recommending  an increased final dividend of 6.1p per Ordinary  Share for the year ended 31 March 201 7  (2016: 5.5p). The proposed annual  dividend is covered 3.0 times by underlying  earnings. The Board’s progressive dividend  policy is unchanged. The Group still has a sizeable pension deficit,  and so the pension scheme will remain as a  significant stakeholder for many years to come. The focus of the Board and the Executive  Management Team is on positioning the Group  to deliver long term organic growth, whilst  also meeting its obligations to all stakeholders. This will be achieved by maintaining and  deepening strong working partnerships  with our customers. The success of an outsourcing business model  such as ours is driven by providing great  customer service and value, maintaining high  levels of contract retention and renewal and by  securing new contracts to grow the business. RESULTS Underlying earnings per share was up by 1 5.9%  over the prior year to 27 .7p, and has increased  by 108.3% since the year ended 31 March 201 3. The Group’s  existing banking facilities were satisfactorily  extended during the year to provide an  appropriate level of maturity. PEOPLE AND THE BOARD Board membership was unchanged during  the year. Adrian Colman has continued to  strengthen the senior management team,  with a healthy mixture of internal promotions  and external appointments; broadening  our talent pool is fundamental to the Group  delivering on its organic growth strategy  and meeting customer expectations. The contribution of the Group’s 1 7 ,500  employees is once again recognised. In an increasingly digitised market our  systems, people and services underpin many  multichannel operations.

Revenue in the year ended 31 March 201 7 was  £1,1 18.1m (2016: £1,1 32.5m excluding WRM),  which represents a year on year decrease of  1.3%. This has been driven primarily by the full  year impact of contracts exited in the prior  year, including all closed book home shopping  contracts in Pullman, partly offset by revenue  from contract wins. Underlying operating profit grew by 7 .0%  to £52.1m (2016: £48.7m excluding WRM),  reflecting a continued strong operating and  financially disciplined performance across  the business, including an improvement in  the performance of the Pullman business  following the exit of loss-making contracts in  the prior year. As a result we have achieved  an underlying operating margin of 4.7%, up  from 4.3% (excluding WRM) in the prior year. Underlying EPS grew a healthy 1 5.9% and  supports the growth in final dividend per share  to 6.1p, resulting in a total 9.1p for the year. Pence 2014 2013 30 16.6 13.3 21.1 23.9 27.7
