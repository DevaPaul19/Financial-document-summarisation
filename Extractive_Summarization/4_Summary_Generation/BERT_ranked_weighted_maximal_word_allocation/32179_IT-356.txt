We received a number of further endorsements from Which? Further to this, we were delighted to receive the accolade of Best  Telecom Services Provider at the recent Which? We also  generated an exceptional profit of £62.3m during the year from the sale of our 20% shareholding in  Opus (see below), taking our total post-tax profit to £95.0m (2016: £31.8m). Full details of the tender offer will be included with the AGM documents which will be sent to all  shareholders shortly. Proposed Energy Price Cap It is encouraging that both the major political parties included a commitment in their recent General Election  manifestos to address one of the main issues within the energy industry, namely the practice by many large  suppliers of using the higher margins earned on disengaged legacy customers to offer significantly cheaper  deals which are only available to those who switch. We anticipate  volumes will start to improve from their current low levels as we start marketing this new service more  pro-actively, and remain confident that Insurance has the potential to make a material contribution to the  financial performance of the group in due course. These new tools were well received, and we have since  seen an encouraging increase in the number of new Partners joining the business. We have invested in providing them with new tools to help them meet this challenge, including the new  suite of films featuring Joanna Lumley, as well as continuing to improve the personal development and  training programmes we make available, free of 12 June 2017 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 12
