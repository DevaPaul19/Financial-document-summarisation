This has resulted in the prior year profit  before tax being restated and as a  consequence the Board has introduced  an alternative performance measure,  adjusted profit before tax, to report  the profitability on the basis that all  forward contracts are accounted for as  effective hedges. 1m Statutory profit   before tax £m £1 17 . The consolidated net assets  and cash balances were not impacted  by the prior year adjustment and the  future cash flows remain unchanged. The Group’s adjusted profit before  tax for the year was £109.1m*, an  increase of 25% compared to £87.5m  last year.
