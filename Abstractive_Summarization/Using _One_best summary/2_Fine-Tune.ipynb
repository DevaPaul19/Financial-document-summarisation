She immediately set out the key \\nmilestones to achieving a step change in \\nthe strategic direction of the Company \\nwith the ultimate objective of improving \\nvalue for all stakeholders. The benefits \\nare already beginning to materialise and \\nthe future attractions of the business as \\nan income generating, residential rental \\ncompany are becoming increasingly clear.\\nIn simple terms, we are shifting the nature \\nof the business from a traditional trading \\nmodel, heavily reliant on house price \\ninflation as a driver of capital value, to \\nan\\xa0investment model with a sustainable \\nand visible income stream from well-run \\nprivate rented residential homes. \\nThe Grainger model continues to \\ncapture over time the full reversionary \\nvalue of our regulated portfolio. \\nThe\\xa0predictable cash flow from these \\nproperties is then reinvested directly  \\ninto developing or acquiring modern, \\npurpose-built residential rental \\nproperties. This is a significant growth \\nmarket in the UK as the demand \\nfor\\xa0homes outstrips supply and the \\noption\\xa0to rent becomes an increasingly \\nattractive and affordable alternative  \\nto buying a home.\\nI am pleased to say that the new \\nmanagement team has lost no time \\nin\\xa0delivering on the milestones set out \\nin\\xa0January 2016 and in reshaping the \\norganisation to support the strategy. \\nDisposals have been made, costs \\nhave\\xa0been cut, and resources have \\nbeen\\xa0concentrated on identifying and \\ncreating\\xa0a strong pipeline of private \\nrented sector (‘PRS’) assets, that build \\non our\\xa0heritage and will deliver strong, \\nsustainable shareholder returns over \\nthe\\xa0coming years. \\nThe transition from strategy to \\nimplementation has been short and \\ndecisive and I would like to thank all of \\nmy colleagues on the Board for their \\ntremendous effort in achieving this. \\nThe\\xa0effective management and proper \\ngovernance of the Group is critical to our \\ncontinued success and I have set out on \\npages 43 to 53 a number of key actions \\nthat we have taken to ensure that it \\nremains of the highest standard.\\nWe have also enjoyed strong support \\nfrom the majority of our Shareholders \\nfor our move to a UK residential rental \\nmodel with a greater focus on reliable \\nincome. Their support of this and our \\nnew management team during this  \\nfirst year of transition has been  \\nmuch appreciated. \\nA period of significant progress\\nStrategic report – Chairman’s letter\\nSadly we have to report that this year \\nwe\\xa0lost Stephen Dickinson, who died \\nafter a short illness. Stephen joined \\nGrainger in 1974 and was an extremely \\neffective Chief Executive of the \\nCompany until 2002, eventually retiring \\nfrom the Board in 2009, and was \\ninstrumental in leading the Company \\nfrom private to public ownership. He \\nwas a wonderful person who left a very \\nstrong legacy and will be much missed \\nby all at Grainger.\\nFinally, we never forget that over 18,000 \\npeople choose to make their home with \\nGrainger. We take that responsibility \\nvery seriously and our staff will continue \\nto go the extra mile for our customers, \\nday in and day out providing the best \\nservice and best support possible. \\nBaroness Margaret Ford \\nChairman \\n1 December 2016\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 8 Highlights\\n NNNAV up 8.9% to 287p\\n Net rental income up 15% \\n Adjusted earnings up 69%\\n Operating costs reduced by 24%\\n Dividend per share increased by 64%\\n Profit before tax up 64% to £84.2m\\nHelen Gordon\\nChief Executive\\nThis is my first full year statement \\nto\\xa0you as Chief Executive of your \\nCompany and\\xa0I\\xa0am pleased to report \\na\\xa0solid performance and the swift \\nexecution of the planned strategic \\nchanges in the business, which will \\nultimately drive all stakeholder value. \\nI set out in this report how we have \\nsimplified and put focus into the \\nbusiness to capture the opportunity \\ncreated by the growing demand for \\nprivate rental housing in the UK. \\nStrategic review\\nIn January I presented my review of \\nthe\\xa0Company’s strategy. The strategy \\npositions Grainger for sustainable \\ngrowth in an emerging sector. It is \\ndesigned to grow rents, simplify and \\nfocus the business and build on the \\noperational strength and foundations \\nof\\xa0over 100 years of renting homes.\\nI was supported in this review by an \\nenthusiastic and engaged leadership \\nteam. The whole of the Grainger team \\nprovided insights and contributions. The \\nreview examined every division and all \\nassets and portfolios were appraised \\nand avenues for growth explored.\\nThe key findings supported our \\nview\\xa0that\\xa0there is a significant market \\nopportunity in an area where Grainger \\nhas unparalleled expertise and \\ncommitted employees ready for change.\\nWe identified the need for Grainger to \\nfocus on growing rental income, to exit \\nnon-UK assets and dispose of assets \\nwhich consume shareholder capital and \\nwere focused on\\xa0capital growth.\\nWe concluded that our regulated \\ntenancy business remains a compelling \\ninvestment with robust cash\\xa0flows. The \\nretention of these assets supports and \\nprovides financing for Grainger’s \\nevolution to our new PRS model. Most \\nimportantly, this PRS model\\xa0will establish \\nGrainger as an income generating quoted \\nvehicle, which\\xa0provides Shareholders \\neasy\\xa0and liquid access to the UK’s \\nhigh-growth PRS\\xa0market, which is \\notherwise only\\xa0achievable through direct \\nreal\\xa0estate\\xa0investment. \\nDelivering on our strategy \\nof\\xa0simplifying the business\\nDuring the year we sold our  \\nnon-core assets and reorganised \\nour\\xa0operational platform. \\nIn January 2016 we agreed to sell our \\nEquity Release business as\\xa0it was no \\nlonger complementary to Grainger’s \\ncore focus. This was completed in \\nMay\\xa02016.\\nHaving decided to sell our German \\nbusiness, we disposed of a series of \\nportfolios. We sold our German joint \\nventure in January. In February we \\nagreed to sell our German business \\nplatform with one of the portfolios, \\nthereby securing the majority of the \\nGrainger employees’ jobs with the new \\nowners and reducing exit costs. The \\nmajority of remaining assets\\xa0were also \\nMaximising the opportunity  \\nin the private rented sector\\nStrategic report – Chief Executive’s strategic review \\nsold by May 2016. We disposed\\xa0of surplus \\nland at Kennel Farm, Basingstoke, and in \\nAugust we were able to secure the \\nunwinding of our\\xa0joint venture in Prague \\nby securing planning consent and \\ndisposing of the land. I am pleased to \\nreport that these disposals have been \\nachieved profitably, while successfully \\nsecuring the future for Grainger \\ncolleagues within those non- core \\nbusinesses under their new owners. \\nThese disposals reduced the quantum \\nand cost of debt and enabled us to \\nembark on a restructuring of our more \\nexpensive debt resulting in further cost \\nreductions. This is explained more\\xa0fully  \\nin the Financial review. In June 2016 we \\nembarked on the restructuring of our \\noperations by removing divisions and \\nrestructuring the\\xa0business into Property \\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 9\\nStrategic report Strategic report – Chief Executive’s strategic review \\ncontinued\\nand Operations (a PropCo/OpCo model) \\nbacked by our central corporate teams. \\nThis is designed to focus on driving \\ncapital and income growth in the \\nbusiness as well as significantly reducing \\noverheads. The benefit of this\\xa0will be \\nfully realised in 2017 when overheads \\nare on track to be 24% lower than \\nin\\xa02015. We will continue to pursue \\nongoing improvements where possible, \\nrealising further cost efficiencies that \\nour new model creates.\\nDelivering on our strategy of \\ngrowing\\xa0rents and dividends\\nThe growth of our rental income is \\nat\\xa0the heart of the strategic objective \\nof\\xa0delivering shareholder returns \\nwhich\\xa0are a balanced mixture of both \\nincome and capital growth. During \\nthis\\xa0transitional period to 2020 we have \\nlinked our dividend directly to net rental \\nincome and will distribute the equivalent \\nof 50% of net rents to Shareholders. \\nThe\\xa0majority of Grainger staff are also \\nShareholders and this approach will \\nfurther incentivise the teams to drive \\nrental growth alongside providing a \\nhigh-quality service.\\nIn January we announced a target that \\nover 50% of our wholly-owned assets \\nwould be modern PRS stock by 2020 and \\nthat by that date net rental income \\nwould\\xa0exceed profit from sales. This is a \\nmodel which is more income focused and \\nstructured to give more sustainable and \\nless volatile returns. \\nWe also announced we would invest \\n£850m (c.£1. 1bn alongside our partners) \\nin\\xa0the PRS between now and 2020. I \\nam\\xa0pleased to announce that we have \\nalready achieved significant progress \\nand\\xa0have secured £389m with a further \\npipeline of £347m of potential sites in \\nthe\\xa0planning or legal process. \\nThe growth in rents has been achieved \\nby new acquisitions but also by the \\noperations team delivering great \\ncustomer service and encouraging \\nour\\xa0customers to stay for longer, and \\nincreasing demand for our homes.\\nDisciplined approach to acquisition\\nWe have restructured our investment \\nand\\xa0acquisitions teams to enable them \\nto\\xa0identify and assess opportunities \\nquickly in our target markets, and \\nprovided\\xa0an investment framework \\nwhich\\xa0is supported by rigorous analysis \\nand in-depth local knowledge. This has \\ndramatically increased the number of \\nopportunities we are evaluating and has \\nenabled us to make good progress on  \\nour pipeline.\\nUK PRS market \\nAs you will read in the market review \\nsection of this report, the demand for \\nrenting is growing and this trend is set \\nto\\xa0continue. Ten years ago, one in ten \\nhouseholds in England rented privately. \\nT oday it is one in five. In London, it is one \\nin four. PwC predicts that 1.8 million new \\nrental homes will be required by 2025 to \\nmeet demand. This demand, coupled \\nwith positive support for the build-to-rent \\nsector and large scale institutional \\ninvestment in the PRS, presents Grainger \\nwith a very compelling opportunity.\\nAs the UK market leader in the \\nresidential\\xa0rental sector, we are targeting \\ninvestment in the PRS in key target cities \\nwhere demand for renting is highest and \\nlocal economic prospects are greatest, \\nincluding cities with top universities \\nand\\xa0good graduate retention, teaching \\nhospitals and strong professional \\nservices.

Whilst \\nwe are clear about our commitment to \\nexisting partners, we believe we should \\ndrive returns for our shareholders and \\nnot take on more third-party property \\nmanagement mandates at this time. \\nOur relationship with APG is important \\nto us and I am delighted that GRIP , our \\nfund with APG, was converted to a Real \\nEstate Investment Trust (REIT) in July \\nof\\xa0this year.\\nOur partners in local and central \\ngovernment are important to \\nus.\\xa0We\\xa0are\\xa0aligned in our objective \\nof\\xa0creating new high-quality homes. \\nGrainger’s longevity and commitment \\nto\\xa0stewardship with communities has \\nbeen evidenced across a number of \\ndevelopment projects. In particular, our \\nwork at Aldershot in\\xa0partnership with the \\nDefence Infrastructure Organisation \\n(part of the Ministry of Defence) and our \\ndevelopments with the Royal Borough of \\nKensington and Chelsea are both worthy \\nof highlighting.\\nWe continue to work with some \\nhousebuilders and to look for ways in \\nwhich to increase the availability of private \\nrental housing stock in the UK which is \\ncomplementary to housebuilders’ needs \\nto build new homes. \\nPolitical and legislative changes\\nThere is an undersupply of quality \\nhousing in the UK and this has been \\nrecognised by central and local \\ngovernment. Whilst the political \\nenvironment has been largely \\nsupportive, the sector was adversely \\naffected by an additional 3% stamp \\nduty land tax surcharge on second \\nhomes in the\\xa0Spring. In June the vote to \\nleave the European Union was seen to \\nhave a negative impact on the housing \\nmarket but was not evidenced in our \\nsales pipeline, and the PRS sector is \\nwidely regarded as one of the most \\nresilient real estate classes post the \\nEU\\xa0referendum.\\nOutlook \\n2016 has been a landmark year for \\nGrainger. The team has worked hard\\xa0to \\nsupport the delivery of the key milestones \\nof the strategy. The UK PRS market is on \\nthe cusp of high growth as it\\xa0provides a \\npractical and compelling solution to the \\nhousing shortage in the UK. Grainger’s \\nestablished leading market position and \\noperational expertise provide us with \\nconfidence that we can capture this \\nmarket opportunity to its fullest. \\n2017 will be an important year for \\nGrainger as we forge ahead with the \\ntransition into a more balanced rental \\nmodel and as we realise the benefits \\nof\\xa0the restructuring and continue to \\nmanage our all-important portfolio \\nof\\xa0regulated tenancies. \\nOur long-term aspirations for \\nGrainger\\xa0are for the business to be the \\nacknowledged leader in the PRS market in \\nthe UK, delivering quality services whilst \\ngenerating strong shareholder returns.\\nGrainger has seen substantial change \\nand I would like to take the opportunity \\nof thanking each and every one of our \\nstaff with whom so much has been \\nand\\xa0will be achieved.

Financial \\n Affordability challenges, lower levels \\nof savings and high mortgage deposit \\nrequirements are some of the key \\ndrivers behind more people choosing \\nto rent over owning, at least for a \\nlonger period of time. In\\xa0particular \\nthe rising cost of buying and selling \\na\\xa0home is making ownership less \\nattractive, particularly for those \\nwho\\xa0want the flexibility in their \\nliving\\xa0arrangements.\\n2.

Starting with our successful \\ngraduate programme, we provide a \\nsupportive environment for learning, \\ndevelopment and progression.\\nDiversity\\nIn order for Grainger to be the best \\nprovider of rental homes to the most \\nnumber of customers, it is critical that \\nwe understand all our customers. It is \\nessential for us to create an environment \\nwhere we can share experiences and \\ninsights to understand our customer \\nbase and to make our business more \\nresilient. Diversity in the business is \\na\\xa0core component of this and we \\nsupport diversity in the workplace. \\nHealth and safety\\nGrainger is committed to protecting \\nthe\\xa0health, safety and welfare of our \\nemployees and customers, and those \\naffected by our business. Our culture \\nsupports a positive and proactive \\napproach to health and safety which \\nis\\xa0designed to be both pre-emptive and \\nproportionate. Through appropriate \\npolicies and procedures we ensure that \\nwe meet our obligations as a \\nresponsible business through \\ninfluencing our supply chain to the \\ngreatest extent possible and ensuring \\nthat everyone in Grainger is responsible \\nfor health and safety and performing \\ntheir activities in a safe manner. An \\nexample of this is the introduction \\nof\\xa0an\\xa0integrated safety, health and \\nenvironmental management system in \\nWellesley, which allows us to maintain \\nand control standards across our supply \\nchain on this large, diverse project.\\nProtecting human rights\\nDue to the nature of our business and \\nour supply chain, we do not consider \\nthe\\xa0risk of human rights abuses a \\nmaterial risk. Following the Modern \\nSlavery Act 2015, we are undertaking \\nan\\xa0internal review of the requirements \\nand implications for our business and \\nwithin\\xa0our supply chain.

We do this \\nthrough a number of ways, including \\neverything from organising family fun \\ndays for residents through to supporting \\nlocal community events and working \\nclosely with other stakeholders to \\npositively influence the future. For \\ninstance, at our development at Young \\nStreet in Kensington, London, we are \\nworking with our building contractor, \\nEllmer, and have introduced a residents \\npanel to provide an open forum for \\ncommunication and engagement. At \\nWellesley we have a Residents T rust \\nwhich consists of a board of residents \\nwho will make decisions about the \\nfuture\\xa0management of the estate \\nand\\xa0community.\\nGrainger is an active contributor to \\nthe\\xa0UK housing debate and engages \\nproactively with central and local \\ngovernment to positively influence \\npolicy to enable our sector to invest \\nin\\xa0more good-quality homes for rent.\\nThrough charitable giving, both employer \\n(£14,467) and employee-led (£29,280), we \\ncollectively gave £43,7 47 to both local and \\nnational charities, including our charity \\npartner, LandAid, which is committed \\nto\\xa0ending youth homelessness by 2026. \\nThrough Grainger’s policy of providing \\na\\xa0day’s paid leave for volunteering, \\nemployees provided 35 days for \\ncharitable\\xa0causes this year.\\nWhere we are developing new \\nhomes\\xa0and neighbourhoods, we \\nundertake and\\xa0also support initiatives \\nthat underpin the\\xa0future success of \\nthe\\xa0area and community. \\nOur business model enables us to offer \\na\\xa0range of housing options, including \\nthose at a more affordable level for those \\non low incomes, while ensuring that each \\nasset is still commercially viable.\\nManaging our impact on \\nthe\\xa0environment\\nAs both an owner and developer of \\nproperty, we are mindful of our impact \\non the environment and our approach \\nhelps secure the future success of the \\nbusiness and protect the value of \\nour\\xa0investments. \\nCreating new homes that are desirable but \\nalso resilient and sustainable is critical to \\nprotecting future value for Grainger and is \\ncentral\\xa0to the specifications and designs\\xa0of \\nour developments.\\nWe actively monitor and take \\naction\\xa0to\\xa0reduce our impact on the \\nenvironment.

Our \\nprogramme of work includes assisting \\nGrainger plc with setting sustainability \\ntargets and reviewing performance against \\nthese targets at year end. Due\\xa0to\\xa0JLL ’s \\nlong-standing relationship with\\xa0Grainger \\nplc, the review of target achievement and \\nthis statement itself\\xa0cannot be considered \\nentirely\\xa0independent. \\nJLL ’s observations and recommendations \\nare based on analysis of documents, \\ninterviews and/or other secondary \\nevidence provided by Grainger plc and \\nrelevant third parties. All reasonable \\nefforts were made to check the quality, \\naccuracy and credibility of the available \\ninformation but this did not include \\nsite\\xa0visits or audits on primary data \\n(e.g.\\xa0meter readings and invoices). \\nConsequently, this statement does \\nnot\\xa0represent formal assurance or \\nverification of the sustainability \\ncontent\\xa0of Grainger plc’s 2016 \\nAnnual\\xa0Report and Accounts. \\nSummary of target performance \\nGrainger’s target performance \\nmust\\xa0be\\xa0placed in the context of the \\nsignificant changes to the Company’s \\nleadership and operations that have \\ntaken place over the past 12 months. \\nOverall, Grainger achieved four of its \\nseven new\\xa0targets for 2016, and two \\nout\\xa0of the\\xa0five targets that were \\ncarried\\xa0over from 2015. \\nProgress was made as Grainger \\ncontinued to embed sustainability \\ninto\\xa0its core processes and procedures, \\nwith successes this year including the \\ncreation of a green lease clause to be \\nrolled out to commercial leases, the \\nintegration of sustainability into \\nGrainger’s development specification \\nand successful pilots of whole life \\ncosting and tenant focus groups.\\nA full review of Grainger’s operating \\nmodel resulted in the decision to place \\ntwo 2016 targets on hold. The remaining \\nfour targets that are in progress will be \\ncarried over for completion in 2017 . \\nObservations and recommendations \\nThe significant organisation and \\nstrategic changes that have taken place \\nduring 2016 have meant that three of \\nGrainger’s sustainability targets were \\neither made redundant or had to be put \\non hold until the changes have been \\nfully implemented. The organisational \\nchanges nonetheless provide Grainger \\nwith an opportunity to realign its \\nsustainability strategy to reflect its new \\nbusiness model. It is an opportunity we \\nencourage Grainger to capitalise on, and \\nover the next year we recommend that \\nthe Company reviews its sustainability \\nstrategy to ensure that it continues to \\ndeliver value for its business. \\nKey to this will be making sure that \\nGrainger focuses on its most significant \\nsustainability impacts in order to channel \\nits resources most effectively. An updated \\nmateriality review, which the Company \\nwas not able to complete in 2016, will \\nsupport this goal and strengthen the \\nCompany’s commitment to transparency \\n(as evidenced by the welcome decision to \\nalign its 2016 sustainability reporting with \\nthe ‘Core’ in accordance with requirements \\nof the recently published Global Reporting \\nInitiative (‘GRI’) Standards). \\nGrainger continues to perform strongly \\nin\\xa0relation to the real estate sector more \\nbroadly. Both Grainger plc and GRIP REIT \\n(formerly GRIP Unit T rust) achieved \\n‘Green Star’ status in the 2016\\xa0Global \\nReal Estate Sustainability Benchmark \\n(‘GRESB’) Assessment, and\\xa0achieved four \\nout of five stars in the\\xa0new\\xa0GRESB Rating. \\nThis places it in\\xa0the\\xa0top two quintiles for \\nreal estate companies globally based on \\nits performance and disclosure. \\nWhile Grainger has put on hold its \\ntarget\\xa0to study the impact on staff \\nwellbeing of its offices, health and \\nwellbeing is also an area where the \\nCompany deserves praise. Grainger was \\none of only 174 real estate organisations \\nglobally to complete the voluntary \\nHealth and Wellbeing module in the \\n2016 GRESB Assessment. Its score of \\n75% places it comfortably above the \\nglobal average of 58% and reflects its \\nsector-leading approach. We encourage \\nGrainger to build on this strong start \\nand investigate further the benefits to \\nboth tenants and Company that can \\nbe\\xa0captured by integrating health and \\nwellbeing into its sustainability strategy. \\nClaire Racine\\nAssociate Director\\nUpstream Sustainability Services JLL  \\n1 December 2016\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 27\\nStrategic report Unlikely Possible Likely Almost certain\\nMinor Moderate Major Extreme\\nLikelihood\\nImpact\\n1\\n10\\n4 5\\n2 3\\n6\\n7 8 9\\nA strong and robust risk \\nmanagement framework\\nStrategic report – Risk management\\nTo achieve our objective of being \\nthe\\xa0UK’s leading PRS landlord we \\nrecognise that we must have a clear \\nunderstanding of the risks we face, \\nboth those inherent in our strategy \\nand operations and those posed by \\nexternal conditions.

This allows the business to identify \\nthose risks which are heavily dependent \\non internal mitigating controls. When \\nforming this assessment the business \\nconsiders a range of risk categories, \\nincluding strategic, market, financial, \\nlegal/regulatory, operational, IT, project \\nand people risks. \\nA risk scoring matrix is used to ensure \\nthat a consistent approach is taken \\nwhen\\xa0assessing the overall impact to \\nthe\\xa0Group. Likelihood is based on the \\nfrequency of occurrence in a rolling \\n12-month period for risks arising within \\noperational areas. These risks, and their \\nimpact and likelihood scores, are \\ndocumented in divisional, unit and \\nproject risk registers. The risk registers \\nare reviewed at least quarterly, and \\nmore frequently as required, then \\ncollated into a Group top risk report \\nfor\\xa0consideration by the Executive \\nCommittee and the Audit Committee.\\n1.

The\\xa0plan is reviewed each year \\nby\\xa0the Board as part of its budget \\nand\\xa0strategy review process. Once \\napproved by the Board, the plan is \\ncascaded down across the Company and \\nprovides a basis for setting all\\xa0detailed \\nfinancial budgets and strategic actions \\nthat are subsequently used by the Board \\nto monitor performance and for the \\nRemuneration Committee to set targets \\nfor the annual\\xa0incentive.\\nStrategic report – Viability statement\\nThe Group’s business model has \\nproved\\xa0to be strong and resilient \\nthroughout the different economic \\ncycles even with higher levels of gearing \\nand over the long term, with consistent \\ndemonstration through its ability to \\nsell\\xa0assets and let vacant properties to \\nprovide stable income returns and cash \\ngeneration, throughout challenging \\nmarket conditions. Currently the Group \\ndirectly owns £1.7bn of residential \\nproperty assets which are relatively \\nliquid, as has been proved in the past. \\nThe Group would remain viable even in \\nthe event of very severe and sustained \\nhouse price deflation as it would be able \\nto accelerate the natural conversion \\nof\\xa0its assets to cash and reduce or \\nsuspend development and acquisition \\nactivity. Only an unprecedented and \\nlong-term lack of liquidity in UK \\nresidential property markets would \\ncause any threat to the\\xa0Group.\\nThe Board has reviewed its strategic \\nand\\xa0financial plans in detail and believes \\nthat a viability assessment period to \\nSeptember 2020 is appropriate as any \\nof\\xa0the principal risks during this period \\ncould be managed. The financial plan \\nbudget has been stress tested against \\nsevere and prolonged reductions in \\nhouse prices.\\nThe financing risks of the Group are \\nalso\\xa0considered to have an impact on \\nthe\\xa0Group’s financial viability. The two \\nprincipal financing risks for the Group are \\nthe Group’s ability to replace expiring \\ndebt facilities and adverse movements in \\ninterest rates. A substantial amount of \\nthe group’s debt facilities mature by \\n2020. A Board approved funding strategy \\nwill address this as we put in place new \\nfacilities to align with the transition to \\nPRS investment assets. The Group has \\ncurrently secured funding to\\xa0deliver the \\nplanned PRS pipeline and\\xa0has prepared \\nthe strategic plan on\\xa0a fully funded basis. \\nIn addition the Group manages its\\xa0hedge \\nexposure with interest rate swaps, caps \\nand fixed rate\\xa0facilities.\\nBased on the results of this analysis, the \\nDirectors have a reasonable expectation \\nthat the Group will be able\\xa0to continue in \\noperation and meet\\xa0its liabilities as they \\nfall due over\\xa0the four-year period of their \\ndetailed assessment.\\nUnderpinned by a robust \\nplanning\\xa0process\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 34 Strategic report – Financial review\\nDelivering performance as  \\nwe reposition for growth\\nFY16 has been a transformational \\nyear, with significant progress made \\nin\\xa0delivering our private rented sector \\n(‘PRS’) growth strategy.

Net\\xa0rental income growth should accelerate towards the end of the strategy period as assets being \\nconstructed are completed and let\\xa0out. \\n4) Reducing reliance on sales (cost coverage)\\n FY16 income covered 74% of costs (FY15: 53%).\\n This benchmark was designed to\\xa0reflect the transition to an increasingly income focused model with reduced reliance on \\ncapital growth and profit from sales. Substantial progress has been made in FY16. Reduced finance costs and lower \\noverheads have been the key drivers. Rental growth and tightly controlled overheads and finance costs are expected to \\ndeliver further benefits. \\nConclusion\\nThis year’s results demonstrate that the\\xa0Company is performing strongly in conjunction with delivering against its strategic \\nobjectives as set\\xa0out\\xa0in January. \\nIt has been a year of significant change\\xa0and progress, with £389m of investment secured, the disposal of two major non-core \\nbusinesses, an improved capital structure, materially reduced finance costs and restructured operations which will deliver \\nfurther efficiencies in FY17 . Alongside these changes, the Company has delivered a 69% increase in adjusted earnings to £53. 1m \\nand a total return (return on shareholder equity) of 10.6%. The actions we are taking to make Grainger a more balanced total \\nreturn business with an increased focus on income returns will support further strategic progress in the coming years.\\nOur 2016 Strategic report, from pages 1 to 42, has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors on 1 December 2016.\\nVanessa Simms\\nChief Financial Officer\\n1 December 2016\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 42 Shareholder engagement\\nThe Board regards strong engagement \\nwith stakeholders and investors as \\nfundamental to maintaining an active \\nongoing dialogue with them and to \\nunderstand their views. \\nHelen Gordon and Vanessa Simms had \\nregular meetings with the Company’s \\nShareholders and analysts, while I have \\nmet with both fund managers and \\ncorporate governance officers of our \\nmajor Shareholders throughout the \\nyear.

A selection \\nof\\xa0the key findings arising from the \\nevaluation are summarised as follows:\\n Board meetings are conducted in an \\neffective manner which encourages \\nopen discussions, with appropriate \\ntime allocated to key issues and \\nstrategy in particular. \\n Committees are performing to a \\nhigh\\xa0standard.\\n Whilst there is always room for \\nimprovement, good progress on the \\nquality of Board information has been \\nmade, which strikes an appropriate \\nbalance between being concise and \\nhaving sufficient detail.\\n Input from each of the Directors \\nduring this year of strategic change \\nwas effective and constructive.\\n Further improvements can be made in \\nrelation to the structure and approach \\nof Non-Executive Director training \\n and development. The Chairman, \\nCompany Secretary and Human \\nResources Director will consider \\nthis\\xa0feedback accordingly and make \\nproposals to the Board to seek to \\nimprove this area.\\nThe review of the Chairman’s \\nperformance, which was led by \\nBelinda\\xa0Richards as Senior Independent \\nDirector, concluded that the Chairman’s \\nleadership and performance were \\neffective and of a high standard. \\nThe Board and its Committees will \\nmonitor progress and continue their \\ncritical review of its effectiveness during \\nthe year ahead. In accordance with the \\nprevailing provisions of the Code, it is the \\ncurrent intention of the Board that the \\nnext external facilitation of the Board \\nevaluation will be carried out in 2017 , \\nbeing three years since the previous \\nexternal evaluation.\\nRe-election of Directors\\nWe continue to adopt the \\nrecommendations of the Code that \\nall\\xa0of\\xa0the Directors offer themselves for \\nre-election annually, notwithstanding \\nthat the Company’s Articles of \\nAssociation require the Directors to offer \\nthemselves for re-election every three \\nyears. Therefore, in accordance with the \\nCode all current Directors, with the \\nexception of Vanessa Simms, will stand \\nfor re-election at the 2017 AGM. As it \\nwill be Vanessa’s first AGM as a\\xa0Director \\nof the Company, she will be subject \\nto\\xa0election by the\\xa0Shareholders at the \\n2017 AGM.\\nIn light of the performance evaluation \\nsummarised above and the provisions \\nof\\xa0the Company’s Articles of Association, \\nthe Board recommends that all of those \\nDirectors proposed for election and \\nre-election are so elected and re-elected \\n(as applicable).\\nThe Board on a site visit to one of our PRS \\ndevelopments in partnership with the Royal \\nBorough of Kensington and Chelsea.\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 50 Internal control\\nThe Board is responsible for reviewing \\nand approving the Group’s system of \\ninternal control and its adequacy and \\neffectiveness. The Group has a cyclical \\nprocess for identifying, assessing and \\nmanaging its significant risks, which has \\nbeen in place for the full year under \\nreview and up to the date of approval \\nof\\xa0the Annual Report and Accounts. \\nThe\\xa0process is designed to enable the \\nBoard\\xa0to be confident that such risks \\nare\\xa0mitigated or controlled as far as \\npossible. It should be noted, however, \\nthat no system can eliminate the risk \\nof\\xa0failure to achieve business objectives \\nentirely and can only provide reasonable \\nand not absolute assurance against \\nmaterial misstatement or loss. \\nThe Audit Committee is delegated the \\ntask of reviewing all identified risks, with \\nthe ultimate key risks retained for full \\nBoard review. The Audit Committee \\nreports to the Board at every Board \\nmeeting subsequent to a\\xa0meeting  \\nof that Committee. Risks and controls  \\nare reviewed to ensure effective \\nmanagement of appropriate strategic, \\nfinancial, operational and compliance \\nissues. The Audit Committee also reviews \\nthe half year and full year financial \\nstatements. In addition, the Group \\noutsources its Internal Audit function \\nwhich performs relevant reviews as part \\nof a programme approved by the\\xa0Audit \\nCommittee. The Committee considers \\nany issues or risks arising from\\xa0an Internal \\nAudit review, so that appropriate actions \\nare undertaken to ensure satisfactory \\nresolution. Internal Audit has a direct \\nreporting line to the Chairman of the \\nAudit Committee. \\nA\\xa0detailed annual budget is produced \\neach\\xa0year, together with longer-term \\nprojections in accordance with the agreed \\nstrategy, which are presented to\\xa0the \\nBoard for consideration and approval. \\nA\\xa0fundamental part of the control \\nprocess is the diligent monitoring of \\nactual performance against this budget \\nby the Board. Where applicable, revisions \\nare made to expected out-turn against \\nwhich\\xa0further progress can be monitored. \\nA detailed monthly management \\ninformation pack is prepared, which \\ncovers each major area of the business \\nand includes detailed consolidated results \\nand financial information for the business \\nas a whole. The performance of each \\nbusiness area is reviewed monthly by \\nboth divisional management and the \\nExecutive Committee and is \\nsubsequently reported to the Board.\\nThe Board also discusses in detail the \\nprojected financial impact of major \\nproposed acquisitions and disposals, \\nincluding their financing. All such \\nproposed substantial investments are \\ninitially considered by the Investment \\nCommittee which comprises all the \\nExecutive Committee and certain senior \\nmanagers. The Board is also responsible \\nfor reviewing and approving the Group’s \\ntreasury strategy, including mitigation \\nagainst changes in interest rates. The \\nGroup’s processes for internal control \\nhave been in place throughout the year \\nand have sought to implement the FRC \\nGuidance on Risk Management, Internal \\nControl and Related Financial and \\nBusiness Reporting. Further details are \\ncontained in the Audit Committee report.\\nThe Board regularly reviews the \\nGroup’s\\xa0processes for internal control \\nand conducts a formal annual review \\nof\\xa0these processes and the risks relating \\nto\\xa0the business.

In that \\ntime, we have refined the process of \\ngovernance having regard to the change \\nin committee structure since 2015, \\nand\\xa0reviewed the work-streams for \\nconsideration by the Committee. In \\nparticular, during this year of strategic \\nchange, the Audit Committee has \\ncarefully considered the risk \\nmanagement framework designed \\nby\\xa0the Executive and the processes in \\nconnection with internal controls that \\nwere applied during the year under \\nreview and going forward. Details  \\nof this\\xa0framework and Grainger’s  \\nrisk appetite are contained on pages  \\n30 to 33.\\nAs a matter of course the Committee \\nconsiders its terms of reference each \\nyear, taking into account changes to \\nGrainger and to external governance \\nrequirements. In addition, we develop \\na\\xa0clear work plan through the year to \\nensure that we fulfil all our \\nresponsibilities. At\\xa0the core of those \\nresponsibilities is ensuring that the \\nCompany is operating an\\xa0effective risk \\nassessment and management process \\nand that an appropriate control \\nframework is in place. We are helped by \\nthe Internal Audit team at Deloitte LLP \\n(‘Deloitte’) which reports directly to\\xa0the \\nCommittee and which works against \\nan\\xa0agreed plan to ensure that controls \\nare effective.\\nOne of the Committee’s other key \\nresponsibilities is ensuring that the \\nGroup’s published accounts have integrity \\nand\\xa0are\\xa0consistent with accounting \\nand\\xa0governance requirements. In \\nachieving this we have given particular \\nconsideration to the viability statement \\nhaving regard to the new strategic focus \\nof Grainger. This included interrogating \\nthe financial models and related \\nsensitivity analysys of various economic \\nscenarios. In addition, we have \\nconcentrated on the fair, balanced and \\nunderstandable requirements for the \\nAnnual Report. In this regard we are \\nhelped by receiving a number of \\nappropriate papers from the Chief \\nFinancial Officer and her team and  \\nby the independent work of our internal \\nand\\xa0external auditors.\\nWe respond to developments during \\nthe\\xa0year as required, focusing on key \\nmatters which arise in addition to our \\nplanned work programme.

In considering \\nthe\\xa0proposals we\\xa0met with external valuers. We reviewed the valuations \\nand, in the case of reversionary assets,\\xa0the\\xa0suggested discount rates \\nprovided. We also confirmed\\xa0that the\\xa0external valuers\\xa0were sufficiently \\nindependent from\\xa0the\\xa0Group.

The contract will be accounted for as a cost plus contract in line \\nwith International Accounting Standard (‘IAS’) 11 Construction Contracts. \\nIn line with the provisions of this standard, revenue will be recognised as it \\nis earned through the duration of the contract. Profits will be recognised \\nto the extent that recoverability is considered probable.

During \\nthe\\xa0year the\\xa0Committee reviewed \\nthe\\xa0external auditor’s own policies \\nand\\xa0procedures for safeguarding its \\nobjectivity and independence. There are \\nno contractual restrictions on the Group \\nwith regard to\\xa0the external auditor’s \\nappointment. The\\xa0audit engagement \\npartner provided his annual \\nrepresentation to the Committee as  \\nto the external auditor’s independence \\nand confirmed that KPMG’s reward and \\nremuneration structure includes no \\nincentives for him to cross sell non-audit \\nservices to audit clients. KPMG duly \\napplies the requirement to rotate audit \\npartners every five years and therefore \\nsuch rotation will be due in respect of \\nthe 2020 audit. \\nThe Committee’s assessment of KPMG’s \\nindependence is underpinned by the \\nGroup’s policy on the use of KPMG for \\nthe provision of non-audit services.  \\nThis policy was reviewed during the year, \\nhaving particular regard to the impact \\nof\\xa0the recent introduction of new audit \\nregulations. The policy contains a \\npresumption against the use of the \\nexternal auditor for non-audit services. \\nKPMG may only be engaged for the \\nprovision of non-audit services in \\ncontravention of that presumption \\nwhere those services are expressly \\npermitted under the policy and where \\nit\\xa0is demonstrable that the external \\nauditor is best suited to undertake \\nthe\\xa0services. The policy includes the \\nrequirement that non-audit services \\nmust not be carried out by the external \\nauditor unless prior approval of the \\nAudit Committee Chairman has  \\nbeen obtained.\\nServices which the external auditor is \\nprohibited from providing to the Group \\ninclude, amongst others:\\n Bookkeeping services and \\npreparation of financial information\\n The design, supply or implementation \\nof financial information systems\\n Appraisal or valuation services\\n Internal audit services\\n Actuarial services\\nFees paid to KPMG during the year are \\nset out in the table below:\\nSchedule of fees\\nYear ended  \\n30 September \\n2016\\nStatutory audit of \\nGrainger Group\\n210,000\\nNew UK GAAP \\nconversion work\\n32,000\\nTotal audit fees 242,000\\nHalf year review 30,000\\nNon-statutory certificate \\non Berewood \\ndevelopment site\\n11,500\\nGerman tax advisory \\nservices\\n48,000\\nLuxembourg tax \\ncompliance services\\n4,000\\nWork relating to disposal \\nof retirement solutions\\n27,000\\nTotal non-audit fees 120,500\\nIn addition, a further £8,000 for \\naudit\\xa0services was billed by KPMG \\nto\\xa0Walworth Investment Properties \\nLimited, the joint venture in which \\nGrainger has a 50% shareholding.\\nThe Committee was satisfied that \\nthe\\xa0overall levels of audit related and \\nnon-audit fees were not material relative \\nto the income of the external auditor \\nfirm as a whole.

Due to the relatively recent \\nappointment of KPMG, the Committee \\nwas satisfied that it was not optimal  \\nto tender external audit services in the \\ncurrent year. The Committee noted that, \\nbased on the prevailing legislation, a \\ncompetitive tender for external auditor \\nmust be held\\xa0no later than 2025.\\nThe Committee monitors the \\nperformance of the external auditor \\nthroughout the year and formally \\nconcludes the assessment of its \\nperformance following conclusion of \\nthe\\xa0annual external audit. Thereafter, \\nthe Committee makes a corresponding \\nrecommendation to the Board on the \\nappointment of the external auditor \\nfor\\xa0the forthcoming financial year. \\nShareholders formally appoint the \\nexternal auditor at\\xa0the AGM in February. \\nIn light of the assessments and review \\nundertaken, the\\xa0Board endorsed the \\nCommittee’s recommendation which \\nwas approved by shareholders in \\nFebruary 2016. When considering the \\nappropriateness of the re-appointment \\nof KPMG as the Group’s external auditor \\nfor the forthcoming year, the Audit \\nCommittee took account of its review \\nof\\xa0the external auditor’s independence \\nand objectivity, the ratio of audit to \\nnon-audit fees and the effectiveness of \\nthe audit process, together with other \\nGovernance – Audit Committee report\\ncontinued\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 58 relevant review processes conducted \\nthroughout the year.

The report has been prepared in \\nline with the recommendations of the \\nUK Corporate Governance Code and the \\nrequirements of the UKLA Listing Rules. \\nThe Directors’ Remuneration Policy \\n(set\\xa0out on pages 65 to 72) will be put to \\nshareholders for approval in a binding \\nvote at the forthcoming AGM.

These metrics combined to \\nensure that Executive Directors were \\nfocused on driving profit from our \\nday-to-day activities at the same time \\nas\\xa0maximising the value of our \\nunderlying assets. In addition, a minority \\nof bonus opportunity was based on how \\nwell our Executive Directors performed \\nagainst an individually tailored scorecard \\nof key performance metrics. \\nWith regard to the performance \\nachieved during the year, we delivered \\nOPBVM of £88.7m and ROSE of 10.6%. \\nThe performance against OPBVM was \\n£7 .8m ahead of the target set for the \\nyear of £80.9m and ROSE was \\nmarginally above mid-range of 5% \\nto\\xa015%. When performance against \\nthese metrics was aggregated with \\nachievement against individually \\ntailored\\xa0strategic targets, annual \\nbonuses ranged from 67% to 76% as \\na\\xa0percentage of the maximum available. \\nFull disclosure of the actual targets set, \\nand performance against those targets, \\nis set out on pages 74 to 76. \\nBelinda Richards\\nCommittee Chairman\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 62 Over the longer term, we have \\nhistorically operated a Long-Term \\nIncentive Scheme (‘LTIP’) that measured \\nour success based on performance \\nagainst NNNAV (50% of an award) \\nand\\xa0absolute total shareholder return \\n(‘TSR’) (50% of an award) targets. \\nOperating in\\xa0tandem, these metrics are \\naligned with creating a strong balance \\nsheet and\\xa0creating shareholder value. \\nThe awards granted in 2013 under \\nthe\\xa0LTIP will be eligible to vest in \\nDecember 2016. With regard to NNNAV \\nperformance over the period ending \\n30\\xa0September 2016, NNNAV has \\nincreased by 47 .2% against the 22.4% \\nincrease in the Halifax and Nationwide \\nHouse Price indices. This will result in \\n40% vesting of this part of the award. \\nIn\\xa0terms of TSR, it is\\xa0currently forecast  \\nto show an annual compound increase \\nin\\xa0the region of 10.7% over the three-\\nyear\\xa0performance period (ending \\n10\\xa0December 2016). Should this level of \\nTSR be maintained to the conclusion of \\nthe performance period, this would result \\nin 57% of this part of the award vesting.\\nIn light of the strong performance \\ndelivered over the relevant performance \\nperiods to date, the Committee is \\ncomfortable, overall, with the level \\nof\\xa0variable pay earned and forecast \\nin\\xa0light of the performance delivered. \\nAlignment of remuneration \\nwith\\xa0strategy\\nAs detailed in the Strategic report, \\nthe\\xa0year under review has been a year \\nof\\xa0change at Grainger. Under new \\nexecutive leadership we undertook \\na\\xa0deep review of every aspect of our \\nbusiness and announced a refined \\nstrategy in January 2016. At the heart \\nof\\xa0our refined strategy is targeting \\nimproved long-term shareholder \\nreturns.\\xa0This is to be achieved through \\na\\xa0combination of growing rents following \\nthe application of a targeted residential \\ninvestment programme and \\nsimplification and focus within our \\nbusiness model through exiting non-core \\nassets and reducing operating costs.\\nIn light of our refined corporate \\nobjectives, and having had regard to the \\nfeedback received from Shareholders \\nin\\xa0relation to our remuneration practices \\nat the time of our 2016 AGM, the \\nCommittee undertook a full review of \\nour approach to remuneration during \\nthe year under review. The objective \\nwas\\xa0to ensure that future policy will \\nsupport Grainger through its next \\nthree-year remuneration policy \\nperiod,\\xa0which will commence from \\nthe\\xa02017 AGM.\\nThe key conclusions of the Committee’s \\nreview were that the current approach \\nto weighting remuneration to long-term \\nperformance remained aligned with our \\noverall strategic objective of improving \\nlong-term returns to Shareholders. \\nHowever, it was agreed that the current \\npolicy should be simplified and updated \\nto take account of developments in \\n‘best\\xa0practice’. As a result, subject to \\nshareholder approval at the AGM, there \\nare a number of revisions to be made to \\nour current Remuneration Policy which \\nare detailed below:\\n Simplifying the annual bonus \\nstructure with the removal of the \\n‘exceptional’ bonus maximum and \\nintroducing part-deferral of annual \\nbonus into Grainger shares\\n Streamlining the LTIP so that only \\nperformance shares will be granted \\nin\\xa0future years (i.e. there will be no \\nfurther awards of matching shares \\nunder the LTIP)\\n The introduction of a two-year \\nholding period on vested LTIP shares\\n A tailoring of incentive plan \\nperformance metrics to better align \\nwith Grainger’s refined strategy. This \\nincludes increasing the weighting on \\nreturn and profitability in the annual \\nbonus and introducing relative total \\nshareholder return and total property \\nreturn into the LTIP\\n Introducing Committee discretion \\nto\\xa0override incentive pay outcomes \\nbased on the application of the \\nconditions set if payouts are not \\nconsidered reflective of overall \\ncompany performance \\n Increasing our share ownership \\nguidelines from 100% to 200% \\nof\\xa0salary\\n The above changes are considered, \\nin\\xa0aggregate, to create a more \\nstrategically aligned and long-term \\nfocused Remuneration Policy. \\nGovernance\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 63 Implementation of policy for 2017\\nThe base salaries of the Executive \\nDirectors will not be increased with \\neffect from 1 January 2017 (see \\nNote\\xa012\\xa0to the Annual Report on \\nRemuneration for more details).\\nAn overview of the changes to our \\ngeneral approach to remuneration  \\nwhich we intend to operate from the \\nAGM are detailed above.

Subject to Shareholders’ \\napproval of the replacement LTIP , this \\nwill enable Grainger to continue to \\noperate a\\xa0LTIP in line with the proposed \\nRemuneration Policy. \\nIn addition, I would highlight that the \\ncurrent HMRC approved all-employee \\nSave As You Earn (‘SAYE’) share scheme \\nwill also reach the end of its ten-year life. \\nConsequently, a resolution requesting \\nshareholder approval in respect of a \\nsuccessor SAYE scheme on similar terms \\nwill also be sought at the 2017 AGM. \\nThe Committee firmly supports the \\nprinciple of broad employee share \\nownership and the previous SAYE \\nscheme was successful in encouraging \\nemployees to\\xa0become owners in \\nGrainger.

The Committee will also operate a general expectation that the guideline will be met within five years of its \\nintroduction, although the Committee reserves the right to take into account vesting levels and personal circumstances when assessing \\nprogress against the guideline. \\nGovernance\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 67 Changes to the Remuneration Policy\\nThe above Remuneration Policy includes \\na number of revisions when compared \\nagainst the Remuneration Policy \\napproved by shareholders at the 2014 \\nAGM. The changes have been made \\nto\\xa0better align remuneration with the \\nrefined Company strategy detailed in \\nthe Strategic report, as well as taking \\ninto account the feedback from our \\nmajor institutional investors.\\nThe key changes included:\\n simplifying the annual bonus \\nstructure so that in future a single \\nbonus maximum will operate as \\nopposed to separate ‘normal’ and \\n‘exceptional’ maximum bonus \\nopportunities.

The key difference \\nis that, overall, the Remuneration Policy \\nfor Executive Directors is more heavily \\nweighted towards variable pay than for \\nother employees. \\nBase salaries are operated under \\nthe\\xa0same policy as detailed in the \\nRemuneration Policy table with any \\ncomparator groups used as a reference \\npoint. The Committee considers the \\ngeneral basic salary increase for \\nthe\\xa0broader Company (if any) when \\ndetermining the annual salary review \\nfor\\xa0the Executive Directors. \\nOutside of the most senior tiers of \\nexecutives, the LTIP is not operated \\nas\\xa0this arrangement is reserved for \\nthose anticipated as having the \\ngreatest\\xa0potential to influence \\nCompany\\xa0level performance.\\nHowever, the Committee believes in \\nwider employee share ownership and \\npromotes this through the operation of \\nthe HMRC tax approved all-employee \\nshare schemes which are open to all \\nUK\\xa0employees. \\nHow the views of employees are \\ntaken\\xa0into account\\nThe Company, in line with current \\nmarket practice, does not currently \\nactively consult with employees on \\nexecutive remuneration.\\nThe Committee takes due account of \\nremuneration structures elsewhere in \\nthe Group when setting pay for the \\nExecutive Directors. For example, \\nconsideration is given to the overall \\nsalary increase budget and the \\nincentive\\xa0structures that operate \\nacross\\xa0the Company.\\nHow the views of Shareholders \\nare\\xa0taken into account\\nThe Remuneration Committee \\nconsiders\\xa0shareholder feedback \\nreceived\\xa0in relation to the AGM each \\nyear and guidance from shareholder \\nrepresentative bodies more generally. \\nThis feedback, plus any additional \\nfeedback received during any meetings \\nheld with Shareholders from time to \\ntime, is then considered as part of \\nthe\\xa0Committee’s ongoing review \\nof\\xa0remuneration policy. \\nApproach to recruitment \\nremuneration\\nWhen setting the remuneration \\npackage\\xa0for a new Executive Director, \\nthe Committee will apply the same \\nprinciples and implement the policy \\nas\\xa0set out in the preceding tables. \\nBase salary will be set at a level \\nappropriate to the role and the \\nexperience of the Executive Director \\nbeing appointed. This may include \\nagreement on future increases up \\nto\\xa0a\\xa0market rate, in line with increased \\nexperience and/or responsibilities, \\nsubject to good performance, where \\nit\\xa0is\\xa0considered appropriate.\\nIn relation to external appointments, \\nthe\\xa0Committee may offer compensation \\nthat it considers appropriate to take \\naccount of awards and benefits that will \\nor may be forfeited on resignation from \\na previous position. Such compensation \\nwould reflect the performance \\nrequirements, timing and such other \\nspecific matters as the Committee \\nconsiders relevant. This may take the \\nform of cash and/or share awards. The \\npolicy is that the maximum payment \\nunder any such arrangements (which \\nmay be in addition to the normal \\nvariable remuneration) should be no \\nmore than the Committee considers \\nis\\xa0required to provide reasonable \\ncompensation to the incoming \\nExecutive Director.\\nIf the Executive Director will be required \\nto relocate in order to take up the \\nposition, it is the Company’s policy \\nto\\xa0allow reasonable relocation, travel \\nand subsistence payments. Any such \\npayments will be at the discretion of \\nthe\\xa0Committee.\\nIn the case of an employee who is \\npromoted to the position of Executive \\nDirector, it is the Company’s policy \\nto\\xa0honour pre-existing award \\ncommitments in accordance \\nwith\\xa0their\\xa0terms.\\nNon-Executive Director appointments \\nwill be through letters of appointment. \\nNon-Executive Directors’ base fees, \\nincluding those of the Chairman, will \\nbe\\xa0set at a competitive market level, \\nreflecting experience, responsibility and \\ntime commitment.

The NNNAV performance measured to \\n30\\xa0September 2016 was 2.11% and so 40% of this part of the award is due to vest and forms part of the 2016 LTIP value. Absolute TSR performance (based \\non an assessment of performance measured to 30 September 2016) is forecast to be 10.7% based on absolute TSR growth of 33%. The share price for \\nthe\\xa0purposes of valuing the award is the share price at 30 September 2016 (230p) for the NNNAV element, and the three-month average share price to \\n30\\xa0September 2016 (221.7p) for the TSR element. This value will be trued up in next year’s report to reflect the actual level of vesting and share price at the \\nvesting date. The 2015 LTIP value has been restated and reflects the actual value of the awards that vested in January 2016.

Emissions are reported \\nfor our operations in the UK for the full \\nreporting period and Germany until the \\nsale of that business which was finalised \\nin April 2016. Grainger reports all \\nmaterial GHG emissions, wherever \\npossible using ‘tonnes of CO\\n2 equivalent’ \\n(tCO 2e) as the unit of measurement. Our \\nreporting period for\\xa0GHG emissions is \\n1\\xa0October 2015 to 30 September 2016. \\nOur portfolio in 2016 changed part-way \\nthrough the\\xa0year with the sale\\xa0of our \\nGerman business in April. \\nOur Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse \\ngas emissions reduced by 16% between \\n2015 and 2016. This was driven by the \\nsale of our German business, and a \\nreduction in energy consumption in our \\nUK offices and the GRIP REIT portfolio \\non a like-for-like basis.\\nOur absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 \\ngreenhouse gas emissions from our \\nUK\\xa0residential and GRIP REIT property \\nportfolios have increased due to the \\nacquisition and development of large \\nproperties including our first Build to \\nRent property, Abbeville Apartments.\\nGovernance\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 87 Our greenhouse gas emissions per £m \\nvalue of assets under management have \\nincreased slightly due to a reduction in \\nthe number of assets following the sale \\nof our German assets and our Equity \\nRelease Division.\\nMethodology\\nGrainger follows the GHG Protocol \\nCorporate Standard (revised edition) \\nand\\xa0ISO14064: Part 1 standard for its \\nreporting. In alignment with the UK \\nGovernment Environmental Reporting \\nGuidelines, we have used the 2016 \\nemissions conversion factor for the \\nOct\\xa02015 – Sep 2016 reporting year. \\nWe\\xa0have reported on all emissions \\nsources required under the Companies \\nAct 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ \\nReports) Regulations 2013. We have used \\nthe operational control consolidation \\nmethod. These sources fall within our \\nconsolidated financial statement. \\nIn 2015 the GHG Protocol guidance \\nwas\\xa0updated advising organisations to \\nprovide separate figures to reflect the \\nmarket and location based emissions \\nresulting from purchased electricity.  \\nThe location-based method uses \\naverage emissions intensity of the grid \\nnetwork for that area; the market-based \\nmethod uses emissions based on \\npurchasing decisions made by Grainger. \\nFor market-based emissions there is a \\nreporting hierarchy and Grainger has \\nused contractual instruments where \\nthere is\\xa0data readily available. We \\npurchase 100% renewable electricity \\ntariffs for GRIP REIT plc which has \\nresulted in reduced Scope 2 emissions \\nusing the market-based approach. \\nWhere no contractual data is available \\nwe use residual mix factors.\\nScope 1 data\\nThis includes landlord-obtained gas \\nconsumed in common areas and by \\ntenants on an unmetered basis as well \\nas fuel consumption in vehicles owned \\nor leased by Grainger plc. Fugitive \\nemissions are not included as they \\nhave\\xa0been assessed to be immaterial.\\nScope 2 data\\nThis includes landlord-obtained \\nelectricity consumed in common \\nareas\\xa0and by tenants on an unmetered \\nbasis as well as electricity consumed \\nby\\xa0Grainger plc in its own offices. \\nThere\\xa0is no purchased heat or steam.\\nScope 3 data\\nThis includes emissions from electricity \\nused by Grainger’s tenants in its \\nUK\\xa0buildings based on EPC analysis \\nand\\xa0extrapolation. Emissions from \\nthe\\xa0transmission and distribution of \\nGrainger’s Scope 2 electricity are \\nincluded. We also report emissions from \\nbusiness travel and from contractors on \\nour development sites and for services \\ndelivered by our repairs and maintenance \\ncontractor. No other Scope 3 emissions \\nare included.\\nRestatements\\nWe have recalculated emissions for 2015 \\nas we are able to report more accurate \\ndata for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions \\nfrom energy consumption in owned \\nproperties and fuel consumption in \\nleased vehicles. In addition we have also \\nrestated our Scope 3 emissions from \\nelectricity transmission and distribution \\nlosses for our offices and owned \\nproperties. We are also able to report \\nmore accurate data for our business \\ntravel Scope 3 emissions.\\nIntensity metrics\\nWe have used three intensity metrics: \\nemissions by market value of assets \\nunder management (tCO\\n2e/£m value \\nof\\xa0AUM), emissions per the number of \\nowned units (tCO\\n2e/owned unit) and \\nemissions per number of employees \\nin\\xa0line with our financial reporting \\n(tCO\\n2e/employee).\\nInternational operations\\nThe remainder of our German portfolio \\nis managed on our behalf by local asset \\nand property managers.\\nHealth and safety\\nGrainger has a well-developed \\nHealth\\xa0and Safety Management \\nSystem\\xa0for the internal and external \\ncontrol of health and safety risks, which \\nis\\xa0managed by the Health and\\xa0Safety \\nDirector. This includes the use of \\nonline\\xa0risk management systems for \\nthe\\xa0identification, mitigation and \\nreporting of real time health and safety \\nmanagement information. The Group \\nHealth and Safety Committee consists of \\nmembers from across the organisation. \\nThe Committee continues to monitor the \\ndelivery of legal compliance in health and \\nsafety through audit and implementation \\nof improvements to enable the Group to \\nbecome ‘best in class’.\\nEmployment of disabled persons\\nThe Company gives full and fair \\nconsideration to applications for \\nemployment made by disabled persons, \\nhaving regard to their particular \\naptitudes and abilities.

A small \\nadjustment in one or more of these \\nassumptions could result in a material \\nchange in the carrying value of \\ninvestment properties.\\nThe valuation approach adopted by \\nthe\\xa0Directors varies between portfolios \\nin order to reflect the nature of each \\ntype of asset:\\n For the Tricomm portfolio, \\nvaluation\\xa0is based on a discounted \\ncash flow model produced by an \\nexternal valuer. There is a risk that \\nthe significant assumptions of house \\nprice inflation (‘HPI’) and discount \\nrates are inappropriate.\\n For properties let into the private \\nrental market, valuation is derived \\nby\\xa0applying a gross initial yield to \\nthe\\xa0estimated rental value of the \\nproperty. The yield applied is based \\non market evidence for comparable \\nproperties and rental growth \\nprospects. Rental value is based \\non\\xa0existing tenancy agreements, \\ncondition and comparable market \\nevidence. Assessing these factors \\nand\\xa0determining the appropriate \\ncomparable evidence involves a \\nhigh\\xa0degree of judgement.\\n Property held in UK residential \\nportfolios is valued by determining \\nvacant possession value (‘VP’) and \\nderiving fair value by applying a \\ndiscount to reflect the fact that the \\nproperty is tenanted. The Directors \\nare assisted in arriving at VP by the \\nin-house surveying team and engage \\nan external valuer to re-perform a \\nsample of valuations. The external \\nvaluer also provides recommendations \\nfor the level of discount to apply from \\nVP to fair value. VP and the discount \\nare based on data derived from \\ncomparable market transactions. \\nThe\\xa0determination of the appropriate \\ndata requires significant judgement.\\nFor all valuations there is a risk that \\ninaccurate or incomplete information is \\nused by the in-house surveying team or \\nthe external valuers in their valuation.\\nOur response:\\nWe engaged a property valuation \\nexpert\\xa0to assist us in assessing the \\nmethodologies and key assumptions \\nused in the valuations adopted \\nby\\xa0the\\xa0Directors for use in the \\nfinancial\\xa0statements.\\nOur procedures to address the risks \\nin\\xa0relation to the three categories of \\nproperty identified above included:\\nThe Tricomm portfolio\\n comparing the key assumptions, \\nincluded in the discounted cash \\nflow\\xa0model relating to HPI and \\nto\\xa0market\\xa0indices;\\n assessing discount rates against \\nmarket information including \\ngilt\\xa0rates and benchmarked \\nrisk\\xa0premiums;\\nPrivate rented sector blocks\\n considering the degree of \\ncomparability and the quality of \\nthe\\xa0market evidence used by the \\nvaluer in determining estimated \\nrental value; and\\n assessing the yield rates applied \\nthrough our understanding of \\nthe\\xa0nature of the assets and \\nbenchmarking against market data.\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 90\\nIndependent auditor’s report to the members of\\xa0Grainger plc only Property held in UK residential portfolios\\n assessing the design of the valuations \\nprocess and sample testing Directors’ \\nvaluations to evaluate if they have \\nbeen prepared in accordance with \\nthe\\xa0process; \\n attending the regional meetings \\nbetween the independent external \\nvaluer and the Group, for properties \\nwhere there is a variance above a set \\npercentage between the VP from the \\nexternal valuer and the Director’s \\nvaluation. By attending these \\nmeetings, together with our valuation \\nexpert, we assessed the degree of \\nchallenge, evidence presented and \\nthe conclusions reached;\\n evaluating the inputs used in the \\nvaluations against our knowledge \\nand experience of the industry, \\nincluding challenging the valuations \\nby comparison with market \\ncomparable transactions and \\nchanges in industry benchmarks; and\\n performing sensitivity analyses over \\nthe identified key assumptions.\\nFor each separate valuation our \\nprocedures included testing whether \\nthe\\xa0property information provided \\nby\\xa0the Group to the independent \\nexternal valuers and/or used by \\nthe\\xa0in- house surveying team was \\ncomplete and accurate. This was \\ncarried\\xa0out by assessing the key \\ninputs\\xa0in\\xa0the Group’s property \\ndatabase,\\xa0such as address, rental \\nincome, occupancy and current \\ntenancy\\xa0details, through a mixture \\nof\\xa0controls testing, including IT \\ncontrols,\\xa0and agreeing inputs to \\nGroup\\xa0property contracts on a \\nsample\\xa0basis.\\nWe compared the investment \\nproperty\\xa0value recorded in the \\nfinancial\\xa0statements to the independent \\nexternal valuers’ reports and assessed \\nthe adequacy of the Group’s disclosures \\nabout the sensitivities and inputs to the \\nvaluations in accordance with relevant \\naccounting standards.\\nCarrying value of inventories (trading \\nproperties) (£904.3m) (2015:\\xa0£1,152.2m) \\nRisk vs 2015: Unchanged\\nRefer to Annual Report page 55 \\n(Audit\\xa0Committee report), Annual \\nAccounts pages 103 to 106 (critical \\naccounting estimates and assumptions) \\nand Annual Accounts page\\xa0133 \\n(accounting policy and financial \\ndisclosures). \\nThe risk: \\nTrading properties are held in \\ninventories\\xa0at the lower of cost and net \\nrealisable value (‘NRV’). Generally, the \\nGroup’s strategy is to sell trading stock \\non vacancy, and therefore the NRV of \\nexisting residential properties is the net \\nproceeds expected on sale with vacant \\npossession. An assessment of the NRV \\nis\\xa0carried out by reference to VP which, \\nas outlined in relation to investment \\nproperty, requires significant judgement \\nto determine.\\nFor land and property developments \\nwhere the intention is to sell on \\ncompletion, NRV is the forecast \\nselling\\xa0price less the remaining costs \\nto\\xa0construct and sell. The key risk is \\nthat\\xa0development inventories continue \\nto be\\xa0held at cost when an impairment \\nshould be recognised, because the \\ntotal\\xa0forecast profits on the individual \\ndevelopments may be overestimated. \\nOur response: \\nResidential trading property\\nThe procedures outlined above in \\nrelation to assessing the process for \\nthe\\xa0valuation of residential portfolio \\ninvestment properties also formed \\npart\\xa0of the response to this risk. Other \\nprocedures included:\\n comparing the value carried in the \\nbalance sheet with the sales price \\nachieved for a selection of property \\nsales after the balance sheet date, \\nand for sales throughout the year \\nas\\xa0a review of the past accuracy \\nof\\xa0the Group’s estimates; and\\n confirming the mathematical \\naccuracy of, and completeness \\nand\\xa0accuracy of inputs to, the \\nDirectors’ assessment and \\nsensitising\\xa0the assessment.\\nDevelopment trading property\\nWe performed a detailed risk assessment \\nat an individual development level to \\nidentify the sites where an impairment \\nmay be required to reduce the carrying \\namount below cost. This included \\ncomparison of the carrying value \\nwith\\xa0market value, estimated by the \\nindependent external valuer of the site \\nin\\xa0its current condition, based on \\ncomparable sales.\\nFor sites where the intention is to \\nsell\\xa0without further development, \\ncomparing the carrying value of \\ninventory to the market value of the \\nsite\\xa0in its current condition, was one \\nof\\xa0our key procedures in challenging \\nNRV assessment.\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 91\\nFinancial Statements For sites where the intention is to sell \\non\\xa0completion, for a sample informed \\nby\\xa0our risk assessment, we inspected \\nthe\\xa0Group’s plans and forecasts used \\nto\\xa0support the NRV assessment, \\nchallenged assumptions against \\nthird- party data, and against experience \\nof actual costs and revenues and \\nperformed sensitivity analyses to assess \\nthe headroom before an adjustment to \\nthe carrying value is required. \\nWe also considered the adequacy \\nof\\xa0the\\xa0Group’s disclosures about the \\ndegree of estimation involved before \\nan\\xa0adjustment to the carrying value \\nis\\xa0required.\\n3 Our application of materiality and an \\noverview of the scope of our audit\\nWe applied materiality at the financial \\nstatement level and a lower materiality \\nfor specific significant accounts. The \\nmateriality for the Group financial \\nstatements as a whole was set at \\n£15.0m (2015: £4.0m), determined \\nwith\\xa0reference to a benchmark of \\nGroup\\xa0total assets, of which it \\nrepresents approximately 1% (2015: \\n£4.0m representing approximately 5% \\nof Group profit before tax normalised to \\nexclude non-recurring items, as \\ndisclosed in Note 4 and averaged over \\nthree years to reduce volatility, of \\n£74. 1m). We concluded that determining \\nmateriality based on total assets was \\nmore consistent with industry peers and \\nappropriately reflects the nature of \\nthe\\xa0business.\\nIn addition, we applied lower materiality \\nof £3. 1 million to the specific income \\nstatement items which depict the \\ntrading performance of the Group, \\nwhich exclude valuation movements, \\ntaxation and results of discontinued \\noperations. We believe misstatement of \\nthese specific income statement items \\nof a lesser amount than materiality for \\nthe financial statements as a whole \\ncould reasonably be expected to \\ninfluence the Company’s members’ \\nassessment of the financial \\nperformance of the Group.\\nWe report to the Audit Committee \\nany\\xa0corrected or uncorrected identified \\nmisstatements exceeding £0.45m (2015: \\n£0.20m), or exceeding £0. 15m where \\nthey relate to specific significant trading \\nbalances listed above, in addition to other \\nidentified misstatements that warranted \\nreporting on qualitative grounds.\\nFollowing the business disposals in \\nGermany (as disclosed in Note 3), the \\nGroup team performed the audit of the \\nGroup as if it was a single aggregated \\nset of financial information. The audit \\nwas performed using the materiality \\nlevels set out above and covered 100% \\nof total Group revenue, Group profit \\nbefore tax and total Group assets (in \\n2015, we identified two components, \\nthe UK and Germany. The UK \\ncomponent was subject to a full-scope \\naudit performed to component \\nmateriality of £3.7m. The German \\ncomponent was subject to audit of \\nspecific balances and classes of \\ntransactions. German component \\nmateriality was £2.0m.

2016 99\\nFinancial Statements\\n \\nConsolidated statement of cash flows\\nFor the year ended 30 September 1\\n Accounting policies\\nAccounting policies applicable across the financial statements are shown below. Accounting policies that are specific to a \\ncomponent of the financial statements have been incorporated in the relevant note. \\n(a) Basis of preparation\\nGrainger plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. It is a public limited liability company listed on the London \\nStock Exchange. The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries, together referred \\nto\\xa0as the ‘Group’, and equity account the Group’s interest in joint ventures and associates. The parent company financial \\nstatements present information about the Company and not the Group.\\nThese financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2016 have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed \\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’), IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 \\napplicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Company has prepared its company financial statements in accordance \\nwith Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101) for the first time this year. Details of the \\nchange in basis of preparation and its impact are shown in Note 1 to the parent company financial statements. These are \\npresented on pages 159 to 167 .\\nThe accounting policies set out below and in the notes to the financial statements, have, unless otherwise stated, been \\napplied consistently to all periods presented in the Group financial statements. Other than the new accounting policy for \\nconstruction contracts, set out in Note 8, no new accounting policies have been adopted in the year and there has been no \\nchange to the basis of accounting estimates in the year.\\nThe Group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the following assets and \\nliabilities, and corresponding income statement accounts, which are stated at their fair value: investment property, derivative \\nfinancial instruments, financial interest in property assets and assets classified as held-for-sale.\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and \\nassumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income \\nand\\xa0expenses. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the events and amounts involved, \\nactual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, \\nor areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in Note 2.\\n(b) Basis of consolidation\\n i) Subsidiaries – Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when \\nthe Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to \\naffect those returns through its power over the entity.\\n Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-\\nconsolidated from the date control ceases. \\n Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are \\neliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the \\npolicies adopted by the Group.\\n100 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016\\nFinancial Statements – \\nNotes to the financial statements  ii) Joint ventures and associates – Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint \\ncontrol, established by\\xa0contractual agreement. Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant \\ninfluence but\\xa0not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. \\nWhere the Group owns less than 50% of the voting rights but acts as property and/or asset manager an assessment \\nis made as to whether or not the Group has de facto control over an investee. This includes a review of the Group’s \\nrights relative to those of another investor or investors and the ability the Group has to direct the investees’ relevant \\nactivities (further detail is provided in Note 19).\\n Investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially \\nrecognised at\\xa0cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the Group’s share of the profit  \\nor loss after the date of acquisition. \\n The Group’s share of its joint ventures’ and associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income \\nstatement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income. \\nWhere the Group’s interest has been reduced to £nil, additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised, \\nonly to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the \\njoint venture or associate. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount  \\nof the investment. \\n Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the \\nextent of the Group’s interest in joint ventures and associates. The accounting policies of joint ventures and \\nassociates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. \\n iii) Business combinations – At the time of acquisition, the Group considers whether each acquisition represents \\nthe\\xa0acquisition of a\\xa0business or the acquisition of an asset. The Group accounts for an acquisition as a business \\ncombination where an integrated set\\xa0of\\xa0activities are acquired in addition to the property. When the acquisition  \\nof a\\xa0subsidiary does not represent a business, it\\xa0is\\xa0accounted for as an acquisition of asset and liabilities. The cost  \\nof acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired\\xa0based\\xa0on their fair values, and no goodwill or  \\ndeferred tax is recognised.\\n iv) Goodwill and impairment – Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of \\nthe\\xa0acquisition is\\xa0measured as the fair value of the assets given and equity instruments issued. Identifiable assets \\nacquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their \\nfair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill\\xa0represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair \\nvalue\\xa0of the Group’s share of net identifiable assets including intangible assets of the acquired entity at the date \\nof\\xa0acquisition. If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of\\xa0the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, \\nthe\\xa0difference is recognised directly in the income statement. Costs attributable to an\\xa0acquisition are expensed \\nin\\xa0the consolidated income statement under the heading ‘Other expenses’. \\n Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included within this caption on the statement of financial position. Goodwill\\xa0 \\non acquisition of joint ventures and associates is included in investments in joint ventures and associates. \\n Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing and is tested annually for \\nimpairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. \\nGains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity\\xa0sold.\\n101\\nFinancial Statements\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 1\\n Accounting policies continued\\n(c) Foreign currencies\\ni) Functional and presentation currency – Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities \\nare measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional \\ncurrency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is the Group’s functional \\nand presentation currency.\\nii)  Foreign currency transactions – Foreign currency transactions are translated at the foreign exchange rates \\nprevailing at the dates of\\xa0the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at \\nthe\\xa0statement of financial position date are\\xa0translated into Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that \\ndate.\\xa0Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions are recognised in \\nthe\\xa0income\\xa0statement.\\niii)  Foreign operations – The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments \\narising on consolidation, are translated to Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the statement of financial \\nposition date. Revenues and\\xa0expenses of foreign operations are translated at average foreign exchange rates for \\nthe\\xa0relevant period. Foreign exchange gains and losses, net of deferred income tax, are recognised within other \\ncomprehensive income.\\niv) Net investment hedges – Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow \\nhedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in \\nother comprehensive income within the translation reserve as part of retained earnings. Any gain or loss relating to \\nthe ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement within ‘Finance costs’. Gains and losses accumulated \\nin\\xa0equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.\\n(d) Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting standards and interpretations\\nThere are no new standards, amendments or interpretations that are effective for the first time for the current financial year \\nthat have a material impact on the Group. \\nThe Group is assessing the impact of the following revised standards and interpretations that are not yet effective. Where \\nalready endorsed by the EU, these changes will be adopted on the effective dates noted. Where not yet endorsed by the EU \\nthe adoption date is less certain. \\n Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012 – 2014, effective 2017 financial year;\\n IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement, effective 2019 financial year (not yet endorsed by the EU);\\n IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective 2018 financial year (not yet endorsed by the EU);\\n IFRS 16 Leases, effective 2020 financial year (not yet endorsed by the EU). This standard replaces the exisiting standard, \\nIAS17 Leases, where lessee’s are required to make a distinction between a finance lease (on balance sheet) and an operating \\nlease (off balance sheet); and \\n IAS 40 Investment Property, proposed amendment. In November 2015 the IASB issued an Exposure Draft on  \\na proposed amendment to clarify situations in which properties can be transferred from investment property to  \\ntrading property and vice versa. The IASB further announced in July 2016 that it has now recommended finalising  \\nthis amendment. The Group anticipate that a number of trading properties will be reclassified as investment property \\nas a consequence of the amendment. \\nOf the other IFRSs that are available for early adoption, none are expected to have a material impact on the  \\nfinancial statements.\\n102 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016\\nFinancial Statements – \\nNotes to the financial statements \\ncontinued 2\\n Critical accounting estimates and assumptions\\nThe Group’s significant accounting policies are stated in the relevant notes to the financial statements. Not all of these \\naccounting policies require management to make subjective or complex judgements or estimates. The following is intended \\nto\\xa0provide further detail relating to those accounting policies that management consider critical because of the level of \\ncomplexity, judgement or\\xa0estimation involved in their application and their impact on the consolidated financial statements. \\nThe Group performs sensitivity analysis as part of the risk management process and we have set out below on page 106 the \\nimpact of changes to key assumptions adopted. \\nValuation of residential property \\nThe Group’s residential trading property is carried in the statement of financial position at the lower of cost and net realisable \\nvalue. The\\xa0Group’s investment property is carried in the statement of financial position at fair value. The Group does, however, \\nin its principal non-GAAP net asset value measures, EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV, include trading stock at market value. The \\nmarket value of the Group’s property which, in the case of investment property, is the same as fair value is detailed below. \\nThe results and the basis of each valuation and their impact on both the statutory financial statements and market value for \\nthe Group’s non-GAAP net asset value measures are set out below:\\nResidential \\n£m\\nDevelopment \\n£m\\nOthers\\n £m\\nFinancial\\nAsset\\n £m\\nTotal\\n £m\\n% of properties \\nfor which \\nexternal valuer \\nprovides \\nvaluation \\n %\\nTrading property 818.8 85.5 – – 904.3\\nInvestment property 261.3 – – – 261.3\\nFinancial asset (CHARM) – – – 93.1 93.1\\nTotal statutory book value 1,080.1 85.5 – 93.1 1,258.7\\nAllsop LLP\\nResidential 1,225.1 – – – 1,225.1 53%\\nGrainger Invest 366.7 – – – 366.7 100%\\nTricomm Housing 116.1 – – – 116.1 100%\\nFinancial asset (CHARM) – – – 93.1 93.1 ***\\nCBRE Limited\\nDevelopments – 78.2 – – 78.2 94%\\nAbbeville Apartments 28.9 – – – 28.9 100%\\nTotal assets at market value 1,736.8 78.2 – 93.1 1,908.1\\nTrading property 1,475.5 78.2 – – 1,553.7\\nInvestment property 261.3 – – – 261.3\\nFinancial asset – – – 93.1 93.1\\nTotal assets at market value 1,736.8 78.2 – 93.1 1,908.1\\nStatutory book value 1,080.1 85.5 – 93.1 1,258.7\\nMarket value uplift* 656.7 (7.3) – – 649.4\\nTotal assets at market value 1,736.8 78.2 – 93.1 1,908.1\\nNet revaluation gain recognised  \\nin the income statement for\\xa0 \\nwholly-owned properties – continuing 20.3 – – – 20.3\\nNet revaluation gain relating to joint \\nventures and associates** – – 12.3 – 12.3\\nNet revaluation gain recognised  \\nin the year – continuing** 20.3 – 12.3 – 32.6\\n* The market value uplift is the difference between the statutory book value and the market value of the Group’s inventories.

A structured sample of these in-house valuations was reviewed by Allsop LLP ,  \\nan external independent valuer. Valuing the large number of properties in the portfolio is a significant task. For this reason,  \\nit is undertaken on an external inspection basis\\xa0only. Invariably, when the in-house valuations are compared to those of the \\nexternal valuer, around 75% of the valuations are within a small acceptable tolerance. Where the difference is more significant  \\nthis is discussed with the valuer to determine the reasons for the difference. Typically, the reasons vary but it could be, for \\nexample, that further or better information about internal condition is available or that respective valuers have placed a \\ndifferent interpretation on comparable sales. Once such reasons have been identified the Group and the valuer agree the \\nappropriate valuation that should be adopted as the Directors’ valuation. \\nOverall, across all of the properties valued by Allsop LLP, the Directors’ valuations were approximately 0.03% lower than the \\nAllsop\\xa0LLP\\xa0values.\\nAllsop LLP has provided the Directors with the following opinion on the Directors’ valuation: ‘Property held in the UK Residential \\nportfolio was valued as at 30 September 2016 by Grainger’s in-house surveyors. These valuations were reviewed and approved \\nby\\xa0the Directors. Allsop LLP has undertaken a comprehensive review of the Directors’ valuation and they are satisfied with the \\nprocess by which the in-house valuations were conducted. As part of the review, Allsop LLP valued approximately 53% of the \\nUK\\xa0Residential portfolio, independently of the Group. Based on the results of that review, Allsop LLP has concluded that they \\nhave\\xa0a high degree of confidence in those Directors’ valuations.’ Allsop LLP also recommend the discount to apply to the vacant \\npossession valuations to establish the market value of each property. For property in the UK Residential portfolio the discounts \\nare established by tenancy type and are based on evidence gathered by Allsop LLP from recent transactional market evidence. \\nAfter due consideration and challenge of Allsop LLP , the Directors have adopted all of the recommendations made by Allsop LLP in \\nrelation to the discounts. Compared to the discounts adopted in 2015, the discounts adopted in 2016 have increased the market \\nvalue of trading stock in the Group’s non-GAAP net asset measures by £8.0m and increased the valuation gain in the income \\nstatement by £1.8m.\\nii) Grainger Invest (‘GInvest’)\\nAll of the property owned by the Group in the GInvest portfolio was valued as at 30 September 2016 by Allsop LLP .\\nThe market values of the properties subject to the assumption that the dwellings would be sold individually, which is deemed to \\nbe\\xa0the highest and best use, in their existing condition, and subject to any existing leases or tenancies was provided by Allsop LLP . \\nThe valuer’s opinion of market value was primarily derived using comparable recent market transactions on arm’s-length terms. \\niii) Tricomm Housing \\nAllsop LLP has also valued as at 30 September 2016 the property assets owned by the Group and let under a long-term lease \\narrangement with the Secretary of State for Defence under a PFI Project Agreement. Allsop LLP has provided an Investment \\nValuation which is defined as ‘the value of an asset to the owner or a prospective owner for individual investment or operational \\nobjectives’. The Investment Valuation has been made in accordance with RICS Professional Valuation Standards, and is based \\non a discounted cash flow model.\\nSignificant unobservable inputs within the valuation relate to assumptions for house price inflation and the discount rates to \\napply to the cash flows. The assumptions adopted for house price inflation are 2.5% in 2017 , 3.5% in 2018 and 2019, 3.0% in \\n2020 and 2021 and 2.75% thereafter. The discount rates applied to the cash flows range between 3.5% and 9.25%.\\n104 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016\\nFinancial Statements – \\nNotes to the financial statements \\ncontinued iv) CBRE – Development\\nThe current market value of the Group’s land and property held within the development segment has been assessed by CBRE \\nLimited who are external independent valuers. Their valuation, representing 94% of the total value of development trading \\nstock, is on the basis of fair value as defined in the RICS Professional Valuation Standards where fair value is the same  \\nas market value. The remaining 6% of the portfolio is a Directors’ valuation. \\nv) CBRE – Abbeville Apartments\\nCBRE have also assessed the current market value of the Abbeville Apartments. The principal approach was to value the \\napartments on an income capitalisation basis, having regard to prevailing market conditions and evidence, and with close \\nregard to the relativity between the Market Value and the aggregate vacant possession value. The valuation has been \\nprepared\\xa0in accordance with RICS Professional Valuation Standards where fair value is the same as market value.\\nv) Joint ventures and Associates\\nProperty assets in the joint venture Walworth Investment Properties Limited (‘WIP’) are valued on the same basis as the \\nGInvest portfolio. Property assets in the associate, GRIP REIT Plc were valued at 30 June 2016 by external valuers, CBRE \\nLimited. In aggregate, the valuation of the individual dwellings as at 30 June 2016 was £599.9m for all assets still held at \\nSeptember. After full consideration of house price movements in those areas where GRIP property assets are situated \\nthe\\xa0Group’s Directors made no adjustment to the 30 June 2016 valuations based on the movement in house price indices \\nto\\xa030\\xa0September 2016, in assessing the Group’s share of GRIP net assets for the purposes of the Group’s accounts to \\n30\\xa0September 2016. \\nThe Directors consider the valuations provided by external valuers to be representative of fair value.\\nAs required by RICS Valuation Professional Standards, all of the external valuers in the UK mentioned above have made full \\ndisclosure of the extent and duration of their work for, and fees earned by them from, the Group, which in all cases are less  \\nthan 5% of their total fees.\\nValuation of financial interest in property assets (CHARM)\\nThe valuation methodology adopted for the CHARM asset is set out in Note 21 to the accounts. \\nThe\\xa0key assumptions affecting the carrying value are house price inflation and the discount rate. The assumptions used to value \\nthe asset adopt an increase in house prices of between 2.5% and 4.0% per annum. \\nA discount rate of 3.5% has been applied to the interest income and a rate of 6.5% has been applied to the projected proceeds \\nfrom sales of the underlying properties, reflecting the risk profile of each individual stream. In previous years, a single discount \\nrate had been adopted. \\nThe fair value of the interest changes as cash flows are realised and an increase of £2.9m (2015: increase of £nil) in the fair value \\nhas been recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income and the available-for-sale reserve. \\nCredit risk arises from the credit exposure relating to cash receipts from the financial instrument. All of the cash receipts are \\npayable by the Church Commissioners, a counterparty considered to be low risk as they have no history of past due or impaired \\namounts and there are no past due amounts outstanding at the year end. \\n105\\nFinancial Statements\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 2\\n Critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued\\nNet realisable value of trading property\\nThe Group’s residential trading properties are carried in the statement of financial position at the lower of cost and net \\nrealisable value. \\nAs the Group’s business model is to sell trading stock on vacancy, net realisable value is the net sales proceeds which the Group \\nexpects on sale of a property with vacant possession. \\nThe Group has a net realisable value provision of £3.2m as at 30 September 2016 (2015: £2.3m) to write down the value of its \\ntrading properties to the lower of cost and net realisable value. This provision relates primarily to properties expected to be sold \\nultimately at vacant possession value. The provision includes specific properties which are vacant\\xa0and properties we expect to \\nbecome vacant on the assumption of an annual vacancy rate of 7 .3%.\\nAfter releasing part of the opening provision against sales made in the year, in aggregate, a charge of £2.7m has been made \\nin\\xa0the 2016 income statement (2015: charge of £1.2m).\\nFor land and property held within the Development segment of the business, net realisable value is the expected net sales \\nproceeds of the developed property and a provision is made when, and to the extent that, total projected project costs exceed \\ntotal projected project revenues. Where land and property is sold without development, net realisable value is the current \\nmarket value net of associated selling\\xa0costs. Decisions regarding whether to develop a site or to sell a site undeveloped are \\nmade by the Directors based on market conditions prevailing at the time. \\nA charge of £0. 1m has been made in the 2016 income statement (2015: charge of £0.2m) in adjusting the book value of \\ndevelopment stock to net realisable value. \\nThe impact of changes to key assumptions is set out in the table below:\\n2016 2015\\nIncome \\nstatement \\nimpact\\nStatement \\nof financial \\nposition \\nimpact\\nIncome \\nstatement \\nimpact\\nStatement \\nof financial \\nposition \\nimpact\\n£m £m £m £m\\nIncrease of 1% in house prices GRIP 1.5 1.5 1.3 1.3\\nDecrease of 1% in house prices GRIP (1.5) (1.5) (1.3) (1.3)\\nIncrease of 1% in house prices NRV provision 0.1 0.1 – –\\nDecrease of 1% in house prices NRV provision (0.1) (0.1) (0.1) (0.1)\\nIncrease of 1% in house prices CHARM 0.7 4.8 0.7 5.5\\nDecrease of 1% in house prices CHARM (0.7) (4.4) (0.7) (5.1)\\nIncrease of 1% in discount rate CHARM – (6.6) – (6.4)\\nDecrease of 1% in discount rate CHARM – 7.5 – 7.4\\nDistinction between investment and trading property\\nThe Group considers the intention at the outset when each property is acquired in order to classify the property as either an \\ninvestment or\\xa0a trading property. Where the intention is to either trade the property or where the property is held for immediate \\nsale upon receiving vacant possession within the ordinary course of business, the property is classified as trading property. \\nWhere the intention is to hold the property for its long-term rental yield and/or capital appreciation, the property is classified \\nas\\xa0an investment property.\\n106 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016\\nFinancial Statements – \\nNotes to the financial statements \\ncontinued Derivative financial instruments\\nFair value measurements for derivative financial instruments are obtained from quoted market prices and/or valuation \\nmodels\\xa0as\\xa0appropriate. When not directly observable in active markets, the fair value of derivative contracts must be computed \\ninternally based on internal assumptions as well as directly observable market information, including forward and yield curves for \\ncommodities, currencies and interest. Changes in internal assumptions and forward curves could materially impact the internally \\ncomputed fair value of derivative contracts, particularly long-term contracts, resulting in corresponding impact on income or loss \\nin the consolidated income statement. The Group utilises an external independent valuer, J C Rathbone Associates Limited, to \\nprovide recommendations on the internal assumptions which have been fully adopted by the Directors.\\nAccounting for unusual contracts \\nIn 2012, the Group entered into a contractual arrangement to build PRS properties on behalf of the Royal Borough of \\nKensington and Chelsea (‘RBKC’). The Group will manage and fund the construction of a number of sites, and will receive \\na\\xa0developers priority return from the sale of units to third parties as they are completed. The construction contract is being \\naccounted for as a cost plus contract in line with International Accounting Standard 11 – Construction Contracts. Revenue \\nof\\xa0£24.1m has been recognised in the year but, as the project is in the early stage of development, no trading profit has yet \\nbeen\\xa0recorded. \\nOnce completed, under a separate arrangement, Grainger will manage the retained units on behalf of RBKC. \\nAdjusted earnings \\nAdjusted earnings is one of Grainger’s key performance indicators. The metric is utilised as a key measure to aid understanding \\nof the performance of the continuing business and excludes valuation movements and non-recurring items that are one-off in \\nnature, which do not form part of the normal ongoing revenue or costs of the business and, either individually or in aggregate, \\nare material to the reported Group results. The classification of amounts as non-recurring is a significant judgement made by \\nmanagement and is a matter referred to the Audit Committee for approval.\\nNon-recurring in 2016 primarily comprises a £10.7m profit from our investment in Prague, restructuring costs of £2.6m, \\nan\\xa0additional provision of £1.3m relating to the provision of a pension and BUPA medical cover to former employees of \\nthe\\xa0company and BPT Limited, and income of £0.8m related to the outcome of a claim against a contractor.\\nAs the business simplifies, management’s view is that the need for items to be classified as non-recurring will reduce.\\nGoing concern\\nThe Directors are required to make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue to trade as a going concern for the \\nforeseeable future.\\xa0The Directors have given this matter due consideration and have concluded that it is appropriate to  \\nprepare the Group financial statements on a going concern basis. The main considerations were as follows:\\ni) Covenant compliance \\nThe Group’s core banking facility has two covenants, being loan-to-value (‘LTV’) and interest cover. At 30 September  \\n2016, the LTV was 35.9% compared to a default level of 75% and the interest cover ratio was 3.86 times compared to \\na\\xa0minimum requirement of 1.35 times. The Group has other bank debt and a £275m corporate bond on which there are \\nalso\\xa0covenant requirements. As at 30 September 2016, the Group is operating comfortably within these requirements. \\nThe\\xa0Directors have reviewed the Group’s financial projections covering a minimum period of at least 12 months beyond \\nthe\\xa0date of signing of these financial statements, and which include covenant compliance forecasts. These projections \\nshow\\xa0that the\\xa0Group will comfortably meet its covenant requirements.\\n107\\nFinancial Statements\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 2\\n Critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued\\nii) Banking facilities \\nThe Group’s existing core facilities were £580.0m on 30 September 2016, of which £302.1m were drawn. The Group had \\nfree\\xa0cash balances plus available overdraft of £43.1m and undrawn committed facilities of £277.9m, in total, ‘headroom’, of \\n£321.0m at 30\\xa0September 2016. The Directors have reviewed the available headroom of the Group, and confirmed that even \\nwithout any further management actions, the Group has sufficient resources to meet future repayments as they fall due. \\nAs has been demonstrated over the past few years, the Group is able to generate strong cash flows even in very difficult \\ngeneral market conditions. The Group’s cash flow projections confirm that the Group will remain well within its facilities for \\na\\xa0minimum period of at least 12 months beyond the date of signing of these financial statements.\\nIn addition, as set out on page 34, the Directors have considered the Group’s viability in detail over a four-year period to \\nSeptember 2020. \\n3\\n Discontinued operations\\nAccounting Policy\\nDiscontinued operations \\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly \\ndistinguished from the rest of the Group and which:\\n represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;\\n is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or\\n is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale. \\nClassification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be \\nclassified as held-for-sale. For the discontinued operation, the comparable statement of profit or loss and OCI has been \\nre-presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year. \\nAssets held for sale \\nAssets are classified as held-for-sale, as defined by IFRS 5, when the assets are available-for-sale in their present condition, \\nthe sale is\\xa0highly probable and it is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification. \\nNon-current assets classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to\\xa0 \\nsell. Assets and liabilities classified as held-for-sale are presented separately as current items in the statement of financial \\nposition. On\\xa0re-classification, investment property that is measured at fair value continues to be measured at fair value.\\nThe Group identified certain of its investment properties as held-for-sale in 2016 in accordance with the criteria set out \\nin\\xa0IFRS 5. \\nDuring the financial year, the Group has disposed of the Retirement Solutions division, other than the CHARM portfolio which \\nhas been retained, and the majority of the German operations. These operations have been classified as discontinued and the \\nprior period consolidated income statement, and where appropriate, related supporting notes to the financial statements, have \\nbeen restated to exclude these operations. The Retirement Solutions business has been classified as a discontinued operation \\ndespite the retention of the CHARM assets as these are clearly distinguishable cash flows. \\n108 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016\\nFinancial Statements – \\nNotes to the financial statements \\ncontinued Retirement Solutions\\nCompletion of the sale of Grainger’s Retirement Solutions business, to Patron Capital Partners and Electra Private Equity plc \\ntook place on 18 May 2016.

This does not reflect the market value of the assets and, accordingly, our \\nkey statement of financial position measures of net asset value include trading stock at market value. The two principal net \\nasset value measures reviewed by the CODM are EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV.\\nNAV is the statutory net assets plus the adjustment required to increase the value of trading stock from its statutory accounts \\nvalue of\\xa0the\\xa0lower of cost and net realisable value, to its market value. In addition, the statutory statement of financial position \\namounts for both deferred tax on property revaluations and derivative financial instruments net of deferred tax, including \\nthose in joint ventures and associates, are added back to statutory net assets. Finally, the market value of Grainger plc shares \\nowned by the Group are added back to\\xa0statutory net assets.\\nNNNAV reverses some of the adjustments made between statutory net assets and NAV. All of the adjustments for the value \\nof\\xa0derivative financial instruments net of deferred tax, including those in joint ventures and associates, are reversed.

The charge is recognised in \\nthe income statement and statement of comprehensive income according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.\\nCurrent tax payable or receivable is based on the taxable income for the period and any adjustment in respect of prior \\nperiods and is\\xa0calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.\\nTax payable upon the realisation of revaluation gains recognised in prior periods is recorded as a current tax charge with \\na\\xa0release of\\xa0the associated deferred tax.\\nDeferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of \\nassets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined \\nusing tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period and are \\nexpected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. \\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will give rise to a future \\ntax liability against which the deferred tax assets can be recovered.\\nDeferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except \\nwhere the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary \\ndifference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against \\ncurrent tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same tax \\nauthority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.\\n121\\nFinancial Statements\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 14\\n Tax continued\\nThe tax charge for the year of £10.9m (2015: £7 .3m) comprises:\\n \\n2016 \\n£m\\n2015 \\nRestated\\n(Note 3) \\n£m\\nCurrent tax\\nCorporation tax on profit 8.0 5.1\\nAdjustments relating to prior years (2.2) (3.7)\\n5.8 1.4\\nDeferred tax\\nOrigination and reversal of temporary differences 9.0 6.9\\nAdjustments relating to prior years – (1.0)\\nImpact of tax rate change (3.9) –\\n5.1 5.9\\nTotal tax charge for the year 10.9 7.3\\nTax charge for the year comprises:\\nTax charge in income statement 9.7 7.4\\nTax from discontinued operations (excluding gain on sale) 1.0 (0.1)\\nTax on sale of discontinued operations 0.2 –\\nTotal tax charge for the year 10.9 7.3\\nThe 2016 current tax adjustments relating to prior years include the utilisation of tax losses and other reliefs available to the \\nGroup which have been included in submitted tax returns.\\nThe Group works in an open and transparent manner and maintains a regular dialogue with HM Revenue & Customs.  \\nThis approach is consistent with the ‘low risk’ rating we have been awarded by HM Revenue & Customs, and to which  \\nthe Group is committed.\\nMovements in tax during the year are set out below:\\n2016 Movement in tax\\nOpening \\nbalance \\n£m\\nPayments \\nmade in \\nthe year \\n£m\\nDisposals/\\nTransfers \\n£m\\nMovements \\nrecognised \\nin income \\n£m\\nMovements \\nrecognised\\n in other \\ncomprehensive \\nincome \\n£m\\nClosing \\nbalance \\n£m\\nCurrent tax 3.0 (1.9) (2.1) 5.8 – 4.8\\nDeferred tax\\nTrading property uplift to fair value on business combinations 18.0 – (3.3) (3.3) – 11.4\\nInvestment property revaluation 12.0 – – 5.0 – 17.0\\nAccelerated capital allowances 0.7 – – (0.9) – (0.2)\\nShort-term timing differences (10.5) – 1.7 4.3 – (4.5)\\nActuarial deficit on BPT Limited pension scheme (0.5) – – – (0.5) (1.0)\\nEquity component of available-for-sale financial asset 1.2 – – – 0.2 1.4\\nFair value movement in cash flow hedges and exchange adjustments (0.6) – – – (1.9) (2.5)\\nDeferred tax total 20.3 – (1.6) 5.1 (2.2) 21.6\\nTotal tax – 2016 movement 23.3 (1.9) (3.7) 10.9 (2.2) 26.4\\n122 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016\\nFinancial Statements – \\nNotes to the financial statements \\ncontinued  \\n2016 \\n £m\\n2015 \\n£m\\nDeferred tax balances are disclosed as follows:  \\nDeferred tax assets: non-current assets 8.6 12.0\\nDeferred tax liabilities: non-current liabilities (30.2) (32.3)\\nDeferred tax (21.6) (20.3)\\nDeferred tax has been predominantly calculated at a rate of 17% (2015: 20%). \\nIn addition to the tax amounts shown above, the Group has a contingent tax liability representing the difference between the \\ncarrying value of trading properties in the statement of financial position and their market value.

In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group \\ndoes not\\xa0hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. Derivatives are classified as current assets and current liabilities. \\nThe derivatives are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequently, the gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is \\nrecognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting in which \\ncase\\xa0any gain or loss is\\xa0taken to equity in a cash flow hedge reserve via other comprehensive income. \\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item \\nbeing hedged and the hedging instrument. The Group is also required to demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective \\non an on-going basis. This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains \\nhighly\\xa0effective.\\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, \\nany\\xa0cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecasted \\ntransaction is\\xa0ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected \\nto\\xa0occur,\\xa0the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.\\nFair value estimation\\nThe fair value of interest rate swaps is based on a discounted cash flow model using market information.\\nDerecognition of financial assets and liabilities \\nDerecognition is the point at which the Group removes an asset or a liability from its statement of financial position. The \\nGroup’s policy is to derecognise financial assets only when the contractual right to the cash flows from the financial asset \\nexpires. The Group also derecognises financial assets that it transfers to another party provided that the transfer of the \\nassets also transfers the right to receive cash flows from the financial asset. When the transfer does not result in the Group \\ntransferring the right to receive cash flows from the financial asset but it does result in the Group assuming a corresponding \\nobligation to pay cash flows to another recipient, the\\xa0financial asset is derecognised.\\nThe Group derecognises financial liabilities only when its obligation is discharged, is cancelled or expires.\\nFinancial assets classified as available-for-sale are the financial interest in property assets. Derivative financial instruments \\nnot in hedge accounting relationships are classified as fair value through profit and loss.  \\n137\\nFinancial Statements\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 28\\n Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued\\nCategories of financial instruments\\nA summary of the classifications of the financial assets and liabilities held by the Group is set out in the following table: \\n2016\\nLoans and \\nreceivables/\\ncash and \\ncash \\nequivalents \\n£m\\nAssets at\\n fair value \\nthrough \\nprofit \\nand loss \\n£m\\nDerivatives \\nused for \\nhedging \\n£m\\nAvailable-  \\nfor-sale \\n£m\\nTotal book \\nvalue \\n £m\\nFair value \\n £m\\nFair value \\nadjustment \\n£m\\nNon-current assets        \\nFinancial interest in property assets – – – 93.1 93.1 93.1 –\\nCurrent assets\\nTrade and other receivables excluding prepayments 57.3 – – – 57.3 57.3 –\\nDerivative financial instruments – 0.3 – – 0.3 0.3 –\\nCash and cash equivalents 90.7 – – – 90.7 90.7 –\\nTotal financial assets 148.0 0.3 – 93.1 241.4 241.4 –\\nLoans and \\nreceivables/\\ncash and \\ncash \\nequivalents \\n£m\\nLiabilities at \\nfair value \\nthrough \\nprofit and \\nloss \\n£m\\nDerivatives \\nused for \\nhedging \\n£m\\nOther \\nfinancial \\nliabilities at \\namortised \\ncost\\n £m\\nTotal book \\nvalue \\n£m\\nFair value \\n £m\\nFair value \\nadjustment \\n£m\\nNon-current liabilities      \\nInterest-bearing loans and borrowings – – – 744.7 744.7 771.5 –\\nCurrent liabilities\\nInterest-bearing loans and borrowings – – – 99.0 99.0 99.0 –\\nTrade and other payables – – – 38.4 38.4 38.4 –\\nDerivative financial instruments – – 13.1 – 13.1 13.1 –\\nTotal financial liabilities – – 13.1 882.1 895.2 922.0 –\\nTotal net financial assets/(liabilities) 148.0 0.3 (13.1) (789.0) (653.8) (680.6) –\\nThe fair value difference relates to the Group’s Corporate Bond, which is stated at amortised cost in the consolidated statement \\nof financial position.

Compliance is monitored by internal audit. Group treasury reports to the Audit Committee.\\nThe Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to financial risk but does not take positions for \\nspeculative\\xa0purposes.\\nThe sources of financial risk and the policies and activities used to mitigate each are discussed below and include credit risk, \\nliquidity risk and market risk, which includes interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit availability risk, house price risk in \\nrelation to the Tricomm Housing portfolio and the CHARM portfolio, our financial interest in property assets, and capital risk.\\nCredit risk\\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss due to a counterparty’s failure to honour its obligations. The Group’s principal financial \\nassets include its financial interest in property assets, bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables. The carrying \\namount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk \\nwithout taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.\\n139\\nFinancial Statements\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 28\\n Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued\\nThe Group’s financial interest in property assets relates to a financial interest in equity mortgages held by the Church of \\nEngland Pensions Board. The Group’s cash receipts are payable by the Church Commissioners, a counterparty considered \\nto\\xa0be\\xa0low risk as they have no history of past due or impaired\\xa0amounts and there are no past due amounts outstanding at \\nthe\\xa0year end.\\nThe Group sometimes enters into sales contracts within the Development division under which a proportion of the consideration \\nis deferred. Each purchaser is subject to financial due diligence prior to sale and the Group retains a legal charge over the land \\nuntil full and final settlement is received. At 30 September 2016, £nil (2015: £nil) was outstanding. \\nThe Group also has credit risk relating to trade receivables. Where it is identified that recovery is doubtful, a provision for \\nimpairment is\\xa0made. For all Assured Shorthold Tenancies, credit checks are performed prior to acceptance of the tenant. \\nRegulated tenants are incentivised through the benefit of their tenancy agreement to avoid default on their rent. Lifetime \\ntenancies are generally at low or zero rent and hence suffer minimal credit risk. Rent deposits and personal guarantees are held \\nin respect of some leases. Taking these factors into account, the risk to the Group of individual tenant default and the credit risk \\nof trade receivables is considered low, as is borne out by the low level of trade receivables written off both in this year and in \\nprior years.\\nTenant deposits of £2.0m (2015: £1.5m) are held which provide some security against rental arrears and property dilapidations \\ncaused by the tenant. The Group does not hold any other collateral as security. Of the net trade receivables balance of £2.6m, \\nwe consider Nil to be not due and not impaired. We consider that all of the £4.2m other receivables balance, and all of the \\n£50.5m amounts recoverable on contracts as not due and not impaired.\\nAs at 30 September 2016, tenant arrears of £0.5m within trade receivables were impaired and fully provided for (2015: £1.8m). \\nThe individually impaired receivables are based on a review of outstanding arrears and an assessment of collectability. Impaired \\nreceivables and receivables not considered to be impaired are not material to the financial statements and, therefore, no \\nfurther analysis is provided. \\nThe credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is managed through the Group’s policies of monitoring \\ncounterparty exposure, monitoring the concentration of credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties and the use of \\ncounterparties of good financial standing. At 30 September 2016, the fair value of all interest rate derivatives that had a positive \\nvalue was £0.3m (2015: £2.0m). \\nAt 30 September 2016, the combined credit exposure arising from cash held at banks, money market deposits and interest rate \\nswaps was £80.3m (2015: £80.2m), which represents 5.0% (2015: 4.7%) of total assets. Deposits were placed with financial \\ninstitutions with A- or better credit ratings.\\nThe Group has the following cash and cash equivalents:\\n2016 \\n £m\\n2015 \\n £m\\nPounds Sterling 79.4 83.5\\nEuros 11.3 5.3\\n 90.7 88.8\\nAt the year end, £42.3m was placed on deposit (2015: £23.4m) at effective interest rates between 0.2% and 0.3% (2015: 0.4% \\nand 0.5%). Remaining cash and cash equivalents are held as cash at bank or in hand.\\nThe Group has an overdraft facility of £1.0m as at 30 September 2016 (2015: £1.0m).\\n140 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016\\nFinancial Statements – \\nNotes to the financial statements \\ncontinued Liquidity risk\\nThe Group ensures that it maintains continuity and flexibility through a spread of maturities. \\nAlthough the Group’s core funding is supported by covenants requiring certain levels of loan to value with respect to the \\nentities in the\\xa0Group of obligors and to maintaining a certain level of interest cover at the Group level, the loan is not secured \\ndirectly against any property allowing operational flexibility. The Group has operated well within its covenants during 2016  \\nand as at 30 September 2016 (see\\xa0Note 2 ‘Critical accounting estimates and assumptions’).\\nThe Group ensures that it maintains sufficient cash for operational requirements at all times. The Group also ensures that it  \\nhas sufficient undrawn committed borrowing facilities from a diverse range of banks and other sources to allow for operational \\nflexibility and to meet committed expenditure. The business is highly cash generative from its sales of vacant properties, gross \\nrents and management fees. In adverse trading conditions, tenanted sales can be increased and new acquisitions can be \\nstopped. Consequently, the Group is able to reduce gearing levels and improve liquidity quickly.\\nThe following table analyses the Group’s financial liabilities and net-settled derivative financial liabilities at the statement of financial \\nposition date into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date. The amounts \\ndisclosed in\\xa0the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. As the amounts included in the table are the contractual \\nundiscounted cash flows, these amounts will not equal the amounts disclosed on the statement of financial position for borrowings, \\nderivative financial instruments, trade and other payables and provisions for liabilities and charges. A\\xa0reconciliation to the statement \\nof financial position amounts is given below for borrowings only. T rade and other payables due within 1 2 months equal their carrying \\nbalances as the impact of\\xa0discounting is not significant.

The Group internally measures its \\nmarket risk exposure by running various sensitivity analyses. The Directors consider that a +/– 1 percent (2015: 1 percent) \\nmovement in interest rates, a +/– 10 percentage point (2015: 10 percentage point) movement in Sterling and a +/– 1 percentage \\npoint (2015: 1 percentage point) movement in house prices represents a reasonable possible change. The approach the Group \\ntakes to each of these risks is set out below. The Group is\\xa0not significantly exposed to equity price risk or to commodity \\nprice\\xa0risk.\\nFair values\\nIFRS 13 sets out a three-tier hierarchy for financial assets and liabilities valued at fair value. These are as follows:\\nLevel 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\\nLevel 2 –  inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  \\nor indirectly; and\\nLevel 3 – unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\\nThe fair value of swaps and other financial instruments is derived from the present value of future cash flows discounted at \\nrates obtained by means of the current yield curve appropriate for those instruments. As all significant inputs required to value \\nthe swaps are observable, they all fall within Level 2.\\nThe CHARM portfolio falls within Level 3, inputs not based on observable market data. The significant unobservable inputs \\naffecting the carrying value are house price inflation and the discount rate. Further details regarding the basis of valuation \\nand\\xa0the sensitivity to changes in the key valuation assumptions are documented in Note 2, ‘Critical accounting estimates and \\nassumptions’. Note 21 provides a\\xa0reconciliation of movements and amounts recognised in the income statement and other \\ncomprehensive income. \\n142 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016\\nFinancial Statements – \\nNotes to the financial statements \\ncontinued Investment property falls within Level 3. The Investment valuations provided by Allsop LLP and CBRE Limited are based on \\nRIC’s Professional Valuation Standards, but include a number of unobservable inputs and other valuation assumptions. In prior \\nyears, investment property has been included within Level 2. However, as all inputs to their valuation on a property by property \\nbasis are not always observable, investment property is better shown within Level 3 and a transfer has been made in the \\ncurrent year to reflect this. Further details of these assumptions and significant unobservable inputs are documented in Note 2, \\n‘Critical accounting estimates and assumptions’.

The statutory book value of fixed rate loans is £275m and their fair value is £301.8m.\\nInterest rate swaps and caps are all classified as either current assets or current liabilities.\\nThe notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap and cap contracts as at 30 September 2016 was \\n£462.2m\\xa0(2015:\\xa0£493.1m). \\nAll of the financial derivatives included in the above table were valued by external consultants, J C Rathbone Associates \\nLimited, using a\\xa0discounted cash flow model and market information and were checked internally using a software package.\\n143\\nFinancial Statements\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 28\\n Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued\\nIn accordance with IAS 39, the Group has reviewed its interest rate hedges. In the absence of hedge accounting, movements \\nin\\xa0fair value are taken directly to the income statement. However, where cash flow hedges have been viewed as being effective, \\nand have been designated as such, any gains or losses have been taken to other comprehensive income through the cash flow \\nhedge reserve.\\nAs at 30 September 2016 the Group’s only fixed rate debt was the £275m quoted corporate bond due December 2020, \\nwhich\\xa0has been valued using quoted market prices, consistent with the approach as at 30 September 2015. JC Rathbone \\nAssociates Limited has valued the Group’s fixed rate debt on a replacement basis, taking into account the difference between \\nthe fixed rates for the Group’s borrowings and the market value and prevailing interest rates of appropriate debt instruments, \\nas a fair value adjustment. The fair values compared to the carrying amounts of the Group’s fixed rate financial liabilities are \\nanalysed below:\\nBook value \\n£m\\nFair value\\n£m\\nFixed rate loan facilities – 30 September 2016 275.0 301.8\\nFixed rate loan facilities – 30 September 2015 464.8 497.1\\nInterest rate risk\\nThe Group’s interest rate risk arises from the risk of fluctuations in interest charges on floating rate borrowings. The Group \\nmitigates this risk through the use of variable to fixed interest rate swaps and caps. This subjects the Group to fair value risk as \\nthe value of the financial derivatives fluctuates in line with variations in interest rates. However, the Group seeks to cash flow \\nhedge account where applicable. The Group is, however, driven by commercial considerations when hedging its interest rate risk \\nand is not driven by the strict requirements of the hedge accounting rules under IAS 39 if this is to the detriment of achieving \\nthe best commercial arrangement.\\nHedging activities are carried out under the terms of the Group’s hedging policies and are regularly reviewed by the Board to \\nensure compliance with this policy. The Board reviews its policy on interest rate exposure regularly with a view to establishing \\nthat it is still relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment. The current Group treasury policy is to maintain \\nfloating-rate exposure of no greater than 30% of expected borrowing. As at 30 September 2016, 87% (2015: 77%) of the \\nGroup’s net borrowings were economically hedged to fixed or capped rates.\\nBased on the Group’s interest rate profile at the statement of financial position date, a 1% increase in interest rates would \\ndecrease annual profits by £1.8m (2015: an increase of £7 .4m). Similarly, a 1% decrease would increase annual profits by \\n£1.8m\\xa0(2015: a decrease of £7.4m). \\nBased on the Group’s interest rate profile at the statement of financial position date, a 1% increase in interest rates would \\nincrease the Group’s equity by £14.5m (2015: £15.6m). Similarly, a 1% decrease would decrease the Group’s equity by \\n£14.5m\\xa0(2015:\\xa0£15.6m). \\nUpward movements in medium- and long-term interest rates, associated with higher interest rate expectation, increase  \\nthe value of the Group’s interest rate swaps that provide protection against such moves. The converse is true for downward \\nmovements in the interest yield curve. Where the Group’s swaps qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39, these movements \\nin\\xa0fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement.\\n144 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016\\nFinancial Statements – \\nNotes to the financial statements \\ncontinued As at 30 September 2016, the market value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39, is a net liability of \\n£13. 1m (2015: £5.0m). The total ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges recognised within the income statement totals a gain of \\n£nil (2015: £0.4m). The fair value movement on derivatives not in hedge accounting relationships and amounts reclassified \\nfrom\\xa0equity to the income statement amounted, in aggregate, to a charge of £9.9m (2015 charge restated: £6.3m) in the \\nincome statement analysed as follows:\\n2016 \\n£m\\n 2015 \\nrestated \\n(Note 3)\\n£m\\nFair value movement on derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges (9.9) (6.7)\\nAmounts reclassified from equity to the income statement – 0.4\\n(9.9) (6.3)\\nAt 30 September 2016, the market value of derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39, is a net asset \\nof\\xa0£0.3m\\xa0(2015:\\xa0a liability of £28.5m).

The Group does not have foreign currency trading with cross border currency flows. The Group hedges \\nforeign currency assets naturally by funding them through borrowings in the applicable foreign currency and aims to ensure \\nthat it has no material unhedged net assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Profit translation is not hedged.\\n145\\nFinancial Statements\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 28\\n Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued\\nThe Group’s statement of financial position translation exposure is summarised below: \\n2016 \\n Euro \\n£m\\n2015 \\nEuro \\n£m\\nGross foreign currency assets 11.4 89.2\\nGross foreign currency liabilities (12.1) (83.3)\\nNet exposure (0.7) 5.9\\nAs at 30 September 2016, it is estimated that a general increase/decrease of 10 percentage points in the value of Sterling \\nagainst the Euro would decrease/increase the Group’s profit before tax by approximately £0.4m (2015: £0.2m) and equity  \\nby Nil (2015: £0.5m).\\nCredit availability risk\\nCredit availability risk relates to the Group’s ability to refinance its borrowings at the end of their terms or to secure additional \\nfinancing where necessary. The Group maintains relationships with a range of lenders and maintains sufficient headroom through \\ncash and committed borrowings. As at 30 September 2016, the Group had available headroom of £321m. The £100m loan from \\nM&G Investments Management Limited was repaid on 6 October 2016. There are no other material maturities of committed \\nborrowings until 2020. \\nHouse price risk\\nThe cash flows arising from the Group’s financial interest in property assets (CHARM) and the Tricomm Housing portfolio are \\nrelated to the movement in value of the underlying property assets and, therefore, are subject to movements in house prices. \\nHowever, consistent with the Group’s approach to house price risk across its portfolio of trading and investment properties, \\nthe\\xa0Group does not seek to eliminate this risk as it is a fundamental part of the Group’s business model.\\nCapital risk management\\nThe Board manages the Group’s capital through the regular review of: cash flow projections, the ability of the Group to \\nmeet\\xa0contractual commitments, covenant tests, dividend cover and gearing. The current capital structure of the Group \\ncomprises a\\xa0mix of debt and equity. Debt is both current and non-current interest-bearing loans and borrowings as set out \\nin\\xa0the consolidated statement of financial position. Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as \\nset\\xa0out\\xa0in\\xa0the consolidated statement of changes in equity.\\nGroup loans and borrowings have associated covenant requirements with respect to loan to value and interest cover ratios. \\nThe\\xa0Board regularly reviews all current and projected future levels to monitor anticipated compliance and available headroom \\nagainst key thresholds. Loan to value is reviewed in the context of the Board’s view of markets, the prospects of, and risks \\nrelating to, the portfolio and the recurring cash flows of the business. The Group is now operating within a range of gearing \\nof\\xa035%–45%, which it considers to be appropriate in the medium term.\\nThe Group monitors its cost of debt and weighted average cost of capital (WACC) on a regular basis. At 30 September 2016, the \\nweighted average cost of debt was 3.9% (2015: 4.6%) and the WACC was 6.02% (2015: 6.22%). Investment and development \\nopportunities are evaluated using a risk adjusted WACC in order to ensure long-term shareholder value is created.\\n146 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016\\nFinancial Statements – \\nNotes to the financial statements \\ncontinued 29\\n Pension costs\\nAccounting Policy\\ni) Defined contribution pension scheme – Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes \\nare\\xa0recognised as an expense in the income statement in the period to which they relate.\\nii)  Defined benefit pension scheme – The Group currently contributes to a defined benefit pension scheme that was \\nclosed to new members and employee contributions in 2003. The full deficit in the scheme was recognised in the \\nstatement of financial position as at 1 October 2004.\\nAn actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out every three years. The cost of providing benefits is determined using the \\nProjected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each statement of financial position date by a \\nqualified actuary, also under the Projected Unit Credit Method, for the purpose of determining the amounts to be reflected \\nin the Group’s financial statements under IAS 19.\\nThe liability recognised in the statement of financial position is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the \\nstatement of financial position date less the fair value of scheme assets. The defined benefit obligation is valued by \\nprojecting the best estimate of future benefit outgoings (allowing for future salary increases for active members, revaluation  \\nto retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for all members) and then discounting to the statement \\nof financial position date.\\nThere are no current or past service costs as the scheme is closed to new members and employee contributions. The net \\ninterest amount, calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability, is reflected in the income \\nstatement each year. Actuarial gains and losses net of deferred income tax are reflected in other comprehensive income \\neach year.\\nDefined contribution scheme\\nThe Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for its employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately \\nfrom those of the Group in independently administered funds. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further \\ncontributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the \\ncurrent and prior periods. Pension arrangements for Directors are disclosed in the report of the Remuneration Committee \\nand\\xa0the Directors’ Remuneration report on pages 62 to 85. The pension cost charge in these financial statements represents \\ncontributions payable by the Group. The charge of £1.0m (2015:\\xa0£1.0m) is included within employee remuneration in Note 11. \\nDefined benefit scheme\\nIn addition to the above, the Group also operates a final salary defined benefit pension scheme, the BPT Limited Retirement \\nBenefits Scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately in funds administered by T rustees and are invested with Rathbones \\nInvestment Management Limited, an independent investment manager. Pension benefits are linked to the members’ final \\npensionable salaries and service at their retirement date (or date of leaving if earlier). The T rustees are responsible for running \\nthe\\xa0scheme in accordance with the scheme’s trust deed and rules, which sets out their powers. The Trustees of the scheme \\nare\\xa0required to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the scheme. There is a requirement that at least one-third of the \\nT rustees are nominated by the members of the scheme. \\nThere are three categories of pension scheme members:\\n Active members: currently employed by the Group. Note no benefits have accrued since 30 June 2003, although active \\nmembers retain a final salary link;\\n Deferred members: former employees of the Group; and\\n Pensioner members: in receipt of pension.\\n147\\nFinancial Statements\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 29\\n Pension costs continued\\nThe defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit payments (allowing for future salary \\nincreases for\\xa0active members, revaluation to retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for all members) \\nand then discounting to the statement of financial position date. In the period up to retirement, benefits receive increases linked \\nto CPI inflation (subject to a\\xa0cap of no more than 5% p.a.). After retirement, benefits receive fixed increases of 5% p.a. The \\nvaluation method used is known as the\\xa0Projected Unit Method. The approximate overall duration of the scheme’s defined \\nbenefit obligation as at 30 September 2016 was 17\\xa0years.\\nThe IAS 19 calculations for disclosure purposes have been based upon the results of the actuarial valuation carried out as at \\n1\\xa0July 2013, updated to 30 September 2016, by a qualified independent actuary.\\nPrincipal actuarial assumptions under IAS 19 (per annum)\\n2016 2015 \\nDiscount rate 2.25% 3.70%\\nRetail Price Index (RPI) inflation 3.10% 3.10%\\nConsumer Price Index (CPI) inflation 2.10% 2.10%\\nSalary increases 3.60% 3.60%\\nRate of increase of pensions in payment 5.00% 5.00%\\nRate of increase for deferred pensioners 2.10% 2.10%\\nDemographic assumptions\\n2016 2015\\nMortality tables for pensioners 100% of S2PA CMI 2015 model with a \\nlong-term rate of improvement of 1.50% p.a.\\nfor males and 1.00% p.a. for females\\n100% of S1PA CMI 2012 model with a \\nlong-term rate of improvement of 1.50% p.a. \\nfor males and 1.00% p.a. for females\\nMortality tables for non-pensioners As for pensioners As for pensioners\\nLife expectancies\\n30 September 2016 30 September 2015\\nMale Female Male Female\\nLife expectancy for a current 60-year-old (years) 87.2 88.6 87.6 89.3\\nLife expectancy at age 60 for an individual aged 40 in 2016 (years) 89.5 90.2 90.1 90.9\\nRisks\\nThrough the scheme, the Group is exposed to a number of risks:\\n Asset volatility: the scheme’s defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate \\nbond yields; however, the scheme also invests in equities. These assets are expected to outperform corporate bonds in \\nthe long term, but provide volatility and risk in the short term.\\n Changes in bond yields: a decrease in corporate bond yields would increase the scheme’s defined benefit obligation; \\nhowever, this would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings. \\n Inflation risk: some of the scheme’s defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore higher inflation will result  \\nin a higher defined benefit obligation (subject to the appropriate caps in place). The majority of the scheme’s assets are \\neither unaffected by inflation, or only loosely correlated with inflation, therefore an increase in inflation would also  \\nincrease the deficit.\\n Life expectancy: if scheme members live longer than expected, the scheme’s benefits will need to be paid for longer, \\nincreasing the scheme’s defined benefit obligation.\\n148 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016\\nFinancial Statements – \\nNotes to the financial statements \\ncontinued The Trustees and Group manage risks in the scheme through the following strategies:\\n Diversification: investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material \\nimpact on the overall level of assets.\\n Investment strategy: the Trustees are required to review their investment strategy on a regular basis. \\nMarket value of scheme assets\\nThe assets of the scheme are invested in a diversified portfolio as follows:\\n30 September 2016 30 September 2015\\nMarket \\nvalue \\n£m\\n% of total \\nscheme \\nassets\\nMarket \\nvalue\\n £m\\n% of total \\nscheme \\nassets\\nEquities 12.2 41% 10.4 39%\\nBonds 11.7 40% 10.8 40%\\nProperties – – 0.5 2%\\nCash 1.5 5% 1.2 4%\\nInsurance policies 4.1 14% 4.0 15%\\nTotal value of assets 29.5 100% 26.9 100%\\nThe actual return on assets over the year was 2.9 0.8 \\nThe assets of the scheme were transferred from Friends Life in the year and are now held with Rathbone Investment \\nManagement Limited in a managed fund.

After a review of all of its occupational leases, \\nthe Directors have concluded that all such leases are operating leases. Payments, including prepayments, made under \\noperating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis \\nover the period of the lease.\\nThe future aggregate minimum lease payments payable by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:\\n2016 \\n£m\\n2015\\n £m\\nOperating lease payments due:\\nNot later than one year 0.8 1.1\\nLater than one year and not later than five years 3.7 4.3\\nLater than five years 1.1 1.9\\n5.6 7.3\\nOperating lease payments represent the lease payments made in the year relating to renting of office space used by the Group, \\ncar leases under contract hire arrangements and operating lease payments relating to office equipment such as photocopiers. \\nLeases relating to office space used by the Group have initial terms of varying lengths, between one and ten years. \\nRent reviews generally take place every five years. Contract hire car leases generally have a three-year term. There are no other \\nsignificant operating lease arrangements requiring disclosure under IAS 17 . \\nThere are no contingent rents recognised within net rental income in 2016 or 2015 relating to properties where the Group acts \\nas a lessor of assets under operating leases. A significant proportion of the Group’s non-cancellable operating leases relate to \\nRegulated Tenancies under which tenants have the right to remain in a property for the remainder of their lives. It is therefore \\nnot possible to estimate the timing of future minimum lease payments. \\n157\\nFinancial Statements\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 37\\n Contingent liabilities\\nThe properties in certain subsidiary companies forming a ‘guarantee Group’ with a market value of £1,181.1m provide the \\nsecurity for the Group’s core debt facility. \\nBarclays Bank plc and Lloyds Bank plc have provided guarantees under performance bonds relating to the Group’s UK \\nDevelopment division. As at 30 September 2016, total guarantees amounted to £2.3m (2015: £2.8m).\\nThe Group has an obligation, under an agreement for sale in relation to its land at West Waterlooville, to pay further \\nconsideration should the site value exceed certain pre-agreed amounts. It also has an obligation under a profit sharing \\nagreement to share profits above an agreed threshold. It is not possible to determine the amount or timing of any such future \\npayments due to the long-term nature of the site’s development and the associated uncertainties. However, our current best \\nestimate is that the earliest payment under these arrangements will not be before October/November 2017 and any payments \\nare likely to be spread over a number of years.\\nAs explained in more detail in Note 20, there is uncertainty relating to the future of the site at Curzon Park in which the Group \\nhas a 50% joint venture interest. Should the value of the site, together with any compensation received, be insufficient to \\nrecover the carrying value of our investment, the Group may incur further charges in excess of those provided in these financial \\nstatements, in respect of obligations to the joint venture.\\n38\\n  Capital commitments\\n \\n2016\\n£m\\n2015\\n£m\\n117.1 63.1\\nThe Group has current commitments under a number of its PRS projects totalling £117 . 1m as at 30 September 2016 \\n(2015:\\xa0£63.1m).\\n39\\n Post balance sheet events\\nAn irrevocable prepayment notice was delivered to M&G Investments Management Limited on the 29 September 2016, setting \\nout the early repayment terms of the £100m term loan due 2021.

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost \\nconvention, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\\nThese are the first financial statements of the Company to be prepared under FRS 101. The Company’s date of transition to \\nFRS 101 is 1 October 2014. The previous financial statements were prepared in accordance with previously applicable UK \\naccounting standards. The adoption of FRS 101 has not resulted in any change to the recognition and measurement principles \\npreviously adopted and so the disclosure requirements of IFRS 1 are not included and the comparatives have not been restated, \\nother than for certain presentational changes. The Company has notified its shareholders in writing about, and they do not \\nobject to, the use of the disclosure exemptions used by the Company in these financial statements. \\nThe application of FRS 101 has enabled the Company to take advantage of certain disclosure exemptions that would have been \\nrequired had the Company adopted International Financial Reporting Standards in full. The exemptions that have been applied \\nin the preparation of these financial statements are:\\n A cash flow statement and related notes have not been presented. \\n Disclosures in respect of new standards and interpretations that have been issued but which are not yet effective have not \\nbeen provided.\\n Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries have not been made. \\n Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial \\nInstruments: DIsclousres have not been made. \\nThe Company has taken the exemption allowed under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from the requirement to \\npresent its own profit and loss account. The loss for the year was £19.7m (2015: £20.5m). These financial statements present \\ninformation about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its Group.\\nThe following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items that are considered material in relation  \\nto the Company’s financial statements. \\n(b) Investments\\nInvestments in subsidiaries are carried at historical cost less provision for impairment based upon an assessment of the net \\nrecoverable amount of each investment. To the extent that the assessment of recoverable amount improves due to change \\nin\\xa0economic conditions, impairment provisions are reversed. \\n(c) Tax\\nCorporation tax is provided on taxable profits or losses at the current rate.\\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet \\ndate, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the \\nfuture have occurred at\\xa0the\\xa0balance sheet date.\\nDeferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences \\nare expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet \\ndate. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 161\\nFinancial Statements\\n \\nNotes to the parent company financial statements 1\\n Accounting policies continued\\n(d)  Own shares including treasury shares\\nTransactions of The Grainger Employee Benefit Trusts are included in the Company’s financial statements.

These share-based arrangements have been treated as equity-settled \\nin the consolidated financial statements. In the Company’s financial statements, the share-based payment charge has been \\nadded to the cost of investment in subsidiaries with a corresponding adjustment to equity.\\n(f) Borrowings\\nBorrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration received, net of transaction costs incurred.

Included within EPRA BPR are six EPRA \\nPerformance Measures deemed to be of key importance to investors in property companies and which aim to encourage  \\nmore consistent and widespread disclosure. The\\xa0EPRA Performance Measures are set out below:\\nPerformance Measure Definition\\n1) EPRA Earnings Recurring earnings from core operational activities. This is a key measure of a company’s underlying \\noperating results providing an indication of the extent to which current dividend payments are \\nsupported by\\xa0earnings.\\n2) EPRA NAV Net asset value adjusted to include properties and other investment interests at fair value and to \\nexclude certain items not expected to crystallise in a long-term property business model. This \\nmeasure is consistent with NAV as defined and disclosed in the Financial review and in Note 5 to the \\nGroup financial statements.\\n3) EPRA NNNAV EPRA NAV adjusted to include the fair values of i) financial instruments, ii) debt and iii) deferred taxes. \\nThis measure is consistent with NNNAV as defined and disclosed in the Financial review and in Note 5 \\nto the Group financial statements.\\n4i) EPRA Net Initial Yield (NIY) Annualised rental income based on cash rents at the balance sheet date, less non-recoverable property \\nexpenses, divided by the market value of the property, increased with (estimated) purchasers’ costs.\\n4ii) EPRA ‘topped-up’ yield This measure incorporates an adjustment to EPRA NIY in respect of the expiration of rent-free \\nperiods (or\\xa0other unexpired lease incentives such as discounted rent periods and step rents).\\n5) EPRA Vacancy Rate Estimated Market Rent Value (ERV) of vacant space divided by ERV of the whole portfolio.\\n6) EPRA Cost Ratios This measure includes all administrative and operating expenses including share of joint ventures’ \\noverheads and operating expenses, net of any service fees, all divided by gross rental income.\\nGrainger is supportive of EPRA’s initiative and, in this report, is disclosing against five of the EPRA measures, EPRA Earnings, \\nEPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV, EPRA Net Initial Yield (NIY) and EPRA Vacancy Rate. EPRA topped-up NIY is\\xa0not appropriate to \\nGrainger’s business. The EPRA Cost Ratios, too, is less relevant to Grainger as it is distorted by the fact that in the reversionary \\nportfolio rental levels are at a sub-market level.\\nIn relation to EPRA NIY and EPRA vacancy rate, the figures shown are in respect of the Grainger wholly-owned market rented \\nassets only. Not included in these numbers are Grainger’s wholly-owned reversionary assets or any assets within joint ventures \\nor associates.\\nThe numbers presented in the tables below for EPRA Earnings, EPRA Earnings per share, EPRA NIY and EPRA Vacancy \\nRate,\\xa0relate to continuing operations only. The 2015 comparatives have been restated to exclude discontinued operations. \\nSee\\xa0Note\\xa03\\xa0to the financial statements for further details of discontinued operations.\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 168\\nFinancial Statements – \\nEPRA Performance Measures The EPRA measures being reported and the calculation of EPRA earnings, EPRA NAV, EPRA NNNAV and EPRA NIY are set \\nout \\xa0below:\\n 2016 2015 \\nEPRA Earnings £41.8m £22.5m\\n2\\nEPRA Earnings per share 10.1p 5.4p\\n2\\nEPRA NAV £1,379.5m £1,334.1m\\nEPRA NAV per share 330p 319p\\nEPRA NNNAV £1,199.5m £1,101.5m\\nEPRA NNNAV per share 287p 263p\\nEPRA Net Initial Yield (NIY)\\n1\\n4.3% 4.4%\\n2\\nEPRA Vacancy Rate\\n1\\n2.1% 2.5%\\n2\\n1 Excludes property that is vacant and is being marketed for sale. \\n2 Restated to exclude discontinued operations.\\n2\\n EPRA earnings – continuing\\n2016 2015 restated\\n Earnings \\n£m\\nShares \\n(millions)\\nPence per \\nshare\\nEarnings\\n£m\\nShares \\n(millions)\\nPence per \\nshare\\nEarnings per IFRS income statement – continuing operations 74.5 414.4 18.0 44.0 412.5 10.7\\nAdjustments to calculate EPRA Earnings, exclude: \\ni) Changes in value of investment properties, development \\nproperties held for investment and other interests (20.3) – (4.9) (14.6) – (3.5)\\nii) Profits or losses on disposal of investment properties, \\ndevelopment properties held for investment and other \\ninterests (1.6) – (0.4) (0.4) – (0.1)\\niii) Profits or losses on sales of trading properties including \\nimpairment charges in respect of trading properties\\n1\\n2.7 – 0.7 1.2 – 0.3\\niv) Tax on profits or losses on disposals – – – – – –\\nv) Negative goodwill/goodwill impairment – – – – – –\\nvi) Changes in fair value of financial instruments and \\nassociated close-out costs 9.9 – 2.4 6.3 – 1.5\\nvii) Acquisition costs on share deals and non-controlling joint \\nventure\\xa0interests – – – – – –\\nviii) Purchase of debt at a discount – – – – – –\\nix) Deferred tax in respect of EPRA adjustments 1.5 – 0.4 1.4 – 0.3\\nx) Adjustments i) to viii) in respect of joint ventures (24.9) – (6.1) (15.4) – (3.8)\\nxi) Minority interests in respect of the above – – – – – –\\nEPRA Earnings/Earnings per share 41.8 414.4 10.1 22.5 412.5 5.4\\n1 Sales of trading property is a fundamental part of Grainger’s business model.

The \\nadjustment to add the value of the Group’s own shares is recognised as these shares do have a market value and this has been the historical basis of the \\nGroup’s calculation. In addition, the number of shares used in the NAV calculation is the total number of shares in issue including those held by the Company \\nin treasury or trust for the purposes of settling future share awards. This should be a close representation of the fully diluted number of shares and so is very \\nunlikely to produce materially different NAV measures.\\n4\\n EPRA NNNAV\\n2016 2015\\n \\nNet assets \\n£m\\nShares \\n(millions)\\nNAV pence \\nper share\\nNet assets \\n£m\\nShares \\n(millions)\\nNAV pence \\nper share\\nEPRA NAV 1,379.5 418.4 330 1,334.1 418.3 319\\nInclude:   \\ni) Fair value of financial instruments (12.0) – (3) (27.9) – (7)\\nii) Fair value of debt (22.3) – (5) (25.8) – (6)\\niii) Deferred tax (145.7) – (35) (178.9) – (43)\\nEPRA NNNAV/EPRA NNNAV per share 1,199.5 418.4 287 1,101.5 418.3 263\\n5\\n EPRA net initial yield (NIY)\\n \\n2016 \\n £m\\n2015 \\nrestated \\n£m\\nMarket value of wholly-owned market rented assets\\n1\\n412.9 356.7\\nAllowance for estimated purchasers’ costs 11.5 10.0\\nGrossed up market value of wholly-owned market rented assets 424.4 366.7\\nAnnualised passing rental income 24.3 21.4\\nProperty outgoings (6.0) (5.3)\\nAnnualised net rents 18.3 16.1\\nEPRA NIY 4.3% 4.4%\\n1 Based on Grainger’s wholly-owned market rented portfolio of property assets excluding assets under construction which has a market value as at 30 September \\n2016 of £461m (2015: £399m) but excluding interests in garages, ground rents and land amounting to £48m (2015: £42m).\\nGrainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 170\\nFinancial Statements – \\nEPRA Performance Measures\\ncontinued 2012 \\n£m\\n2013 \\n£m\\n2014 \\n£m\\n2015 \\nrestated \\n £m\\n2016 \\n£m\\nRevenue 311.4 283.2 319.1 193.1 219.9\\nGross proceeds from property sales 250.5 347.1 267.2 149.3 164.8\\nGross rental income 89.8 71.3 57.4 46.7 51.9\\nGross fee income 10.0 12.5 12.3 5.0 5.9\\nOperating profit before valuation and non-recurring items (OPBVM) 126.4 107.6 107.5 79.5 88.7\\nProfit/(loss) before tax (1.7) 64.3 81.1 51.4 84.2\\nProfit after tax 0.4 53.6 74.7 44.0 74.5\\nDividends taken to equity 7.6 8.0 8.5 10.4 14.7\\n Pence Pence Pence Pence Pence \\nEarnings per share 0.1 13.1 18.1 10.7 18.0\\nDividends per share 1.9 2.0 2.5 2.8 4.5\\n Pence Pence Pence Pence Pence \\nGross net asset value per share 223.0 242.0 290.6 319.0 329.7\\nTriple net asset value per share 157.1 194.7 242.0 263.4 286.7\\nShare price at 30 September 107.7 174.8 185.5 238.0 230.0\\n% % % % %\\nReturn on capital employed (ROCE) 5.9 8.1 17.0 11.0 8.4\\nReturn on shareholder equity (ROSE) 3.8 25.2 25.6 10.0 10.6\\nThe 2015 results in the table above have been restated in order to be comparable with 2016 results following the disposals \\nmade in the current financial year.
